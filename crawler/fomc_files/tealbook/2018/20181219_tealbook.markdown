Monetary Policy Alternatives
Information received since the Committee met in November indicates that the
labor market has continued to strengthen. In November, the unemployment rate held
steady at 3.7 percent and, despite some slowing, the 3-month average of payroll gains, at
170,000 per month, remained well above the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the
labor force. Real GDP is projected to grow 3 percent over this year. The staff continues
to expect above-trend real GDP growth through 2019 and high levels of resource
utilization over the medium term. The 12-month changes in headline and core PCE
prices were 2 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, in October. The staff projects that
core PCE inflation will edge back up to 1.9 percent by year-end and then run at 2 percent
over the medium term. Headline PCE inflation is projected to be below core inflation
through 2019, reflecting the recent large declines in oil prices, but to run in line with the
core rate thereafter. The staff has not significantly altered its outlook in light of the
recent movements in financial market prices.
Against this backdrop, the alternative policy statements presented below offer a
range of options for the current setting of policy and the expected path going forward.
Alternative B is written with a view that the economy has evolved roughly in line with
the Committee’s expectations, thus meriting another increase in the target range for the
federal funds rate at the December meeting. To acknowledge that the extent of future
policy tightening has likely diminished as the target range has risen, and to indicate
somewhat less conviction about the expected path of the federal funds rate, the draft of
Alternative B modifies the forward guidance language in paragraph 2. In particular, the
draft states that the Committee “judges” that “some” further gradual increases in the
target range will be consistent with achieving the Committee’s goals. Additionally, by
making only modest changes to the statement through the adoption of Alternative B, the
Committee would communicate that the recent volatility in financial markets has not
caused a significant shift in the Committee’s outlook for the economy or monetary policy
at this time.
Alternative C is written from the perspective that the incoming data continue to be
stronger than is sustainable and that, in order to contain eventual inflation risks, the
FOMC should signal that the federal funds rate will likely need to rise to a higher level
than has been implied by previous communications. Under this alternative, the
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 13, 2018

--- Page 5 ---

Committee would raise the target range at this meeting and signal that further gradual
increases are likely to be warranted.
Alternative A is motivated by an assessment that the current stance of monetary
policy, at this time, is appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives, and that further
gradual increases in the target range could unduly slow the economic expansion and
forestall the sustained return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Under
this alternative, the Committee would maintain the current target range for the federal
funds rate and signal a pause in the current tightening cycle.
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C:
 The assessment of the incoming data:
o Alternatives A and B have very similar characterizations of the incoming data,
both of which are little changed from the November FOMC statement. While
Alternative B again reports that both overall and core inflation “remain near
2 percent,” Alternative A notes that both “have softened but remain near
2 percent.”
o Alternative C emphasizes that the labor market “continued to tighten,” citing
“robust” job gains and noting that “the unemployment rate is at multi-decade
lows.”
 The outlook for economic activity and inflation, the associated risks, and the
monetary policy path upon which the outlook is conditioned:
o As in November, Alternative B projects “sustained expansion of economic
activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,” and notes that risks to
this outlook are “roughly balanced.” These outcomes are achieved with
“some further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate.
o Alternative A offers the same outlook for economic activity and inflation as
Alternative B. However, under Alternative A, the Committee does not
condition the economic outlook on “some further gradual increases” in the
federal funds rate; instead, the Committee “judges that the current target range
for the federal funds rate at this time is consistent with” sustained economic
expansion and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.
sevitanretlA

--- Page 6 ---

o Alternative C also offers essentially the same outlook for economic activity,
the labor market, and inflation as Alternative B, but states that “further
gradual increases” are “warranted” to achieve this outlook. Additionally,
Alternative C states that risks are “roughly balanced” only for “economic
activity,” thereby implying some upside risk to the outlook for inflation.
 The current policy decision and the outlook for policy:
o Alternative B raises the target range to 2¼ to 2½ percent.1 With the outlook
conditioned on “some further gradual increases,” such a statement would
acknowledge that the Committee anticipates slowing its pace of tightening
after December.
o Alternative A maintains the current target range. By removing the reference
to “further gradual increases” and indicating that the Committee judges that
the current level of the federal funds rate is appropriate “at this time,” such a
statement would signal a pause in raising rates.
o Alternative C also raises the target range by 25 basis points. With “further
gradual increases” in the federal funds rate “warranted” to keep inflation near
the Committee’s objective and sustain the economic expansion, such a
statement would signal that the Committee judges that it will eventually need
to raise the federal funds rate to a higher level than has been implied by its
previous communications.
1 The implementation note associated with Alternatives B and C embeds the assumption that the
Federal Reserve would make another technical realignment of the interest rate paid on required and excess
reserve balances relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, bringing the spread to
10 basis points.

NOVEMBER 2018 FOMC STATEMENT
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic
activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average,
in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending
has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has
moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both
overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near
2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on
balance.
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with
sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and
inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium
term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to
2-1/4 percent.
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic
conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric
2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range
of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and
international developments.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Available data indicate that the labor market has continued to strengthen.
o Nonfarm payroll gains averaged about 170,000 in the three months ending in
November, well above the pace that the staff projects is consistent with no
change in resource utilization.
o The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 percent in November, down
0.4 percentage point since the end of 2017, and below all participants’
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the September
Summary of Economic Projections.
o Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the year ending in November,
consistent with a strong labor market.
 The staff estimates that output currently stands about 2¼ percent above its potential
level, and anticipates that the output gap will widen to about 3 percent in 2020 before
narrowing.
 Inflation is projected to remain close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent goal.
o The 12-month change in headline PCE prices was 2 percent in October, while
core PCE prices came in a little below staff expectations at 1.8 percent.
o Despite its dip in October, the staff projects core PCE inflation to remain close
to 2 percent over the medium term. While recent declines in oil prices are
expected to weigh on headline PCE inflation in early 2019, the effect of these
declines on inflation is anticipated to be transitory and this measure is
expected to return to 2 percent over the remainder of the medium term.
o Against the backdrop of a pickup in productivity growth, growth in unit labor
costs has remained modest.
o Measures of inflation expectations continue to suggest that long-term inflation
expectations remain well-anchored. While market-based measures of
inflation compensation have decreased somewhat, they have stayed within the
range of readings over recent years. Survey-based measures of longer-run
inflation expectations have remained steady.
 Movements in asset prices indicate that risk sentiment deteriorated somewhat further,
on balance, since the November FOMC meeting. Equity prices and Treasury yields
sevitanretlA
Authorized for Public Release
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 13, 2018

--- Page 12 ---

have declined, and yields and spreads on corporate bonds have increased, particularly
for speculative-grade debt. Financial conditions for businesses and households have
tightened a bit, according to a range of indicators. However, despite these recent
developments, financial conditions continue to remain supportive of the economic
expansion.
 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced. Upbeat household and business
sentiment, as reflected in recent readings, could combine with the ongoing boost from
fiscal stimulus enacted last year to cause spending and investment to expand faster
than in the staff projection. In addition, sustained low levels of unemployment may
give rise to greater inflation pressures than anticipated by the staff. Conversely, a
slowdown in foreign growth, adverse trade policy shocks, or significant further
tightening in financial conditions pose downside risks for economic activity.
Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may see an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate in
December as consistent with earlier communications indicating that further gradual
increases in the target range would be appropriate if the economy evolved about as
anticipated.
 Policymakers may also judge that “some” further gradual increases in the target range
will be appropriate in order to balance the risks associated with resource utilization
becoming overly tight against the risk of unduly slowing the economy, potentially
leading to below-target inflation.
o Policymakers may view the reference to “some” further tightening as an
acknowledgement that, with an increase in the target range in December, they
anticipate only relatively limited additional tightening.
o Policymakers may also prefer to replace the word “expects” with “judges” to
communicate more clearly the Committee’s current level of conviction
regarding the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range.
 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run close to the Committee’s
symmetric 2 percent inflation goal as some further gradual tightening of monetary
policy is carried out.
o Policymakers may see an increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting,
along with some future gradual increases in conjunction with ongoing
sevitanretlA

--- Page 13 ---

balance-sheet reduction, as containing the risk that inflation will rise
appreciably above 2 percent.
o Policymakers may also view the stability of longer-term inflation expectations
as consistent with achieving the Committee’s inflation objective.
 Market quotes along with responses to the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers
and market participants indicate that an increase in the target range is seen as highly
likely at the December meeting (see the box, “Monetary Policy Expectations and
Uncertainty”). Survey respondents have also noted policymakers’ communications
about potential changes to the forward guidance language. Consequently, a statement
along the lines of Alternative B seems unlikely to generate substantial changes in
asset prices.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty
Market participants appear to remain confident that the Committee will
announce a 25‐basis‐point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate
at the December FOMC meeting. In contrast, expectations for the federal funds
rate beyond 2018 moved down, suggesting that investors expect the federal
funds rate to rise less quickly and to a lower level than at the time of the
November meeting.
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts implies that
investors attach about 85 percent odds to a 25‐basis‐point increase in the target
range for the federal funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting (the left‐most
blue bar in figure 1). This probability does not take into account the widely‐
expected technical adjustment to the rate of interest on reserves (IOR).
Assuming that the IOR rate will be raised by only 20 basis points at the December
meeting, these quotes would instead imply that investors are near certain of a 25‐
basis‐point increase in the target range (the cumulative area covered by the blue
and red bars).1 Respondents to the Desk’s December surveys assigned, on
average, about 80 percent odds to a rate increase at the upcoming meeting.
Expectations for the federal funds rate beyond 2018 have fallen over the
intermeeting period. The market‐implied probability of a rate hike at the March
2019 FOMC meeting, unadjusted for term premiums, has fallen from 70 percent
to about 30 percent (figure 1).2 And the probability distribution for the level of
the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 implied by options quotes, also
unadjusted for term premiums, has shifted to the left (figure 2), with the mean of
the distribution falling from 2.9 to 2.6 percent. The corresponding average
probability distribution from the December Desk surveys has also shifted lower
(figure 3), albeit by less; the mean of the survey‐based distribution fell from 2.8 to
2.7 percent. Survey respondents now place the highest odds on two 25‐basis‐
point rate increases in 2019 (at the time of the November surveys, respondents
attached roughly equal probability to two or three rate hikes).
Forward rates implied by OIS quotes (the light‐blue lines in figure 4) decreased by
30, 44, and 37 basis points on net at the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Under the assumption of zero term premiums, these market‐implied forward
rates suggest that investors expect the federal funds rate to reach about 2.6
percent at the end of 2019 before falling a bit in 2020. The expected path of the
federal funds rate adjusted for term premiums using a staff term structure model
(the red lines in figure 4) has declined by less and continues to point to a higher
1 About 90 percent of the respondents who answered the question in the Desk’s
December surveys expect the spread between the top of the target range for the federal
funds rate and the IOR rate to widen from the current 5 basis points to 10 basis points
following the December meeting.
2 The probability of a rate hike at the January 2019 FOMC meeting remains close to zero.
sevitanretlA

--- Page 15 ---

expected path for the federal funds rate, reaching about 3 percent by the end of
2019 and gradually rising in 2020.
As shown in figure 5, the most recent expected path for the federal funds rate
implied by the staff model (the red line) is roughly consistent with the median of
respondents’ modal projections from the December Desk surveys (the brown
line) but now lies somewhat below the Committee’s September median SEP
projections (the dark blue dots) for the end of 2019 and 2020. The survey‐implied
mean path (the golden squares) continues to lie noticeably below the survey‐
implied modal path, suggesting that survey respondents perceive the risks to the
economic outlook as skewed towards the downside.
Figure 6 shows measures of the longer‐run expected federal funds rate. A
straight read of forward rates at longer horizons implied by Treasury securities
(the blue line) suggests that investors’ current expectation for the average
federal funds rate from 5 to 10 years ahead is about 3 percent, about 35 basis
points lower than at the time of the November meeting. Adjusting for term
premiums using various staff term structure models (with the light‐red region
showing a range of three such model estimates) continues to suggest that 5‐to‐
10‐year‐ahead expectations are above the unadjusted forward rates, at between
3.3 and 3.9 percent. In contrast, surveys of professional forecasters suggest that
longer‐run expectations remain close to the unadjusted forward rates; the
average longer‐run forecast from the December Blue Chip survey (the yellow
diamonds) and the median forecast from the latest Desk surveys (the green
diamonds) were 3.1 and 2.9 percent, respectively.
The December Desk surveys also asked several questions pertaining to the
average size and composition of the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet in
2025, assuming the economy would not move back to the effective lower bound
between now and then. The median of respondents’ projections for the level of
reserve balances in 2025 was $1.1 trillion, about $350 billion above the median
projection reported in the June survey, when this question was last asked; this
increase could reflect the results of the Senior Financial Officer Survey that were
published in late November, and the FOMC’s discussion of its future
implementation framework as reported in the minutes of the November
meeting. In a new question, respondents were also asked to provide their
projection for the lowest weekly level they expected reserve balances to reach
between now and the end of 2025, assuming the economy does not move back
to the effective lower bound. The median respondent projected that reserve
balances will decline to a trough of $1 trillion, with 90 percent of the respondents
who answered the question projecting a trough between $500 billion and $1.4
trillion. The median respondent projected the fourth quarter of 2020 as the most
likely date when the par value of the domestic SOMA portfolio will first exhibit
quarter‐over‐quarter growth.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is operating appreciably beyond full
employment and that economic activity—which is expanding at a faster-than-
sustainable rate—will continue to be spurred by expansionary fiscal policy.
o The unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s, is below all
estimates of the longer-run normal level of unemployment reported in the
September Summary of Economic Projections, and is projected to decline
slightly further.
 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to
emerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tightness. This tightness
is apparent through widespread reports of shortages of qualified employees and
evidence of supply constraints in certain sectors.
 Policymakers may judge that broader financial conditions continue to be
accommodative relative to historical experience, and that financial imbalances, which
are already present, may grow larger. Although the federal funds rate and key interest
rates for household and business borrowers have increased, they have risen from very
low levels, and the increases have occurred alongside some easing in non-price credit
terms and standards.
Policy Strategy
 To keep inflation near 2 percent and sustain the economic expansion over the medium
term, policymakers may judge that the target range for the federal funds rate will
likely need to be raised to a higher level than has been suggested by previous FOMC
communications.
o Policymakers may be focused on indicators of a strong labor market, such as
the employment-to-population ratio of prime-age workers, which at nearly
80 percent has returned to levels last seen in 2007. They may be concerned
that this labor market tightness, combined with ongoing above-trend economic
growth, could soon result in more notable upward pressure on inflation.
o They may also see a need to prevent the unemployment rate from declining
significantly further below its normal longer-run value. Such a further decline
could make it increasingly challenging to engineer a soft landing should
inflation pick up following a prolonged period of tight resource utilization.
sevitanretlA

Page 14 of 34

--- Page 18 ---

 Policymakers may note that, even with a rate hike at their December meeting, the
federal funds rate would still lie below prescriptions from a wide range of policy
strategies—including those from most of the simple policy rules shown in the
“Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook A. To the extent that these
prescriptions have provided reasonable characterizations of past Committee behavior,
policymakers may believe that large, prolonged deviations from these prescriptions
risk unmooring inflation expectations or exacerbating other imbalances.
 In order to avoid a significant buildup of financial imbalances, policymakers may see
the need to signal a higher end-point for the tightening cycle than has been previously
communicated by the Committee.
 For the above reasons, policymakers may opt to increase the target range for the
federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting and indicate that “further
gradual increases” are “warranted.”
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that risks to the outlook
appear roughly balanced specifically for the outlook for economic activity. This
could signal, by omission, policymakers’ concern that risks to the outlook for
inflation may not be balanced.
 While financial market participants regard a rate hike at the upcoming meeting as
highly likely, the guidance contained in Alternative C would come as a surprise and
would likely cause policy expectations to ratchet up next year and potentially farther
out. In response to a statement like Alternative C, near-term real interest rates would
likely rise, equity prices and inflation compensation could fall, and the dollar could
appreciate.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
Economic Conditions and Outlook
 Policymakers may see that, although inflation has softened recently, it remains close
to 2 percent and that it is projected to remain near that level on a sustained basis.
 Moreover, policymakers may see little evidence of labor market overheating.
o Wage pressures remain subdued even as the unemployment rate has moved
down since the beginning of the year. Although measures of labor
compensation have firmed over the past two years, so has productivity
growth. As a result, growth of unit labor costs has been modest, making it
less likely that the low level of the unemployment rate will lead to inflation
rising appreciably above 2 percent.
 Policymakers may note that the high growth rate of real GDP in the first three
quarters of 2018 was associated with a number of temporary factors, and that real
GDP growth is projected to decline steadily over the next few years, in part reflecting
waning fiscal impetus.
 Policymakers may see developments in Treasury markets—particularly the further
flattening of the nominal yield curve—as supporting the view that the current level of
the federal funds rate is close to its neutral level.
 Policymakers may judge recent developments across broader financial markets to be
evidence of nascent downside risks to economic activity, which additional tightening
of monetary policy would likely exacerbate.
Policy Strategy
 Policymakers may judge that both objectives of the dual mandate are nearly fulfilled.
They may deem it prudent to leave the target range for the federal funds rate
unchanged “at this time” while they assess incoming information so as not to
undermine the expansion of economic activity and the sustained return of inflation to
2 percent.
o Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust, the
economy has shown few signs of overheating. The labor market has
improved at a steady pace over the past few years without generating a sizable
increase in either unit labor cost growth or inflation. Moreover, inflation
expectations have remained stable over this period.
sevitanretlA

--- Page 20 ---

o Policymakers may also view substantial risks associated with tightening too
quickly or too much. Such policy actions could undermine the expansion or
cause inflation to run persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.
A restrictive policy stance could be reflected in an inversion of the yield
curve—a development that has historically been associated with recessions.
Furthermore, a slowdown in growth abroad or trade policy developments
could also restrain the economy over the near term. Thus, they may feel that
only conditional on a flatter path of the policy rate are risks to the outlook
roughly balanced.
o Policymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic activity with
a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken place over the
past few years will continue to act as a restraint on economic growth for some
time, mitigating the need for more increases in the target range for the federal
funds rate at this stage. Policymakers may believe that pausing now could
provide an opportunity to ascertain with greater precision the stance of
monetary policy.
 Policymakers may continue to view the current state of the financial system as sound
and the potential for a significant buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, or
they may judge that interest rate policy is not an effective means of addressing any
significant financial stability concerns that may emerge.
 Financial market participants are broadly expecting a rate hike at the upcoming
meeting; against this backdrop, adoption of a statement such as Alternative A would
certainly be a surprise. Expectations for rate hikes in the near future would fall, and
medium- and longer-term interest rates could decline as well. If investors viewed
monetary policy as simply being more accommodative than previously expected,
equity prices and inflation compensation could rise and the dollar could depreciate.
Conversely, if market participants viewed the statement as signaling a less optimistic
economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation could fall.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range for the federal funds
rate, an implementation note that indicates no change to the Federal Reserve’s
administered rates—the interest rate on required and excess reserve balances, the offering
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primary credit rate—would be
issued. If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, an
implementation note that communicates the changes the Federal Reserve decided to make
in these three policy tools would be issued. Draft implementation notes that correspond
to these two cases appear on the following pages; the implementation note for the latter
case assumes that a technical adjustment to the setting of the interest rate on required and
excess reserve balances would be made at this meeting. Struck-out text indicates
language deleted from the November directive and implementation note, bold red
underlined text indicates added language, and blue underlined text indicates text that

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November
8 December 19, 2018:
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ]
to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at
2.20 percent, effective November 9 December 20, 2018.
 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy
directive:
“Effective November 9 December 20, 2018, the Federal Open Market
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as
necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to
2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and
reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only
by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds
$30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed
securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received
during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations
from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.
The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon
swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.”
 In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
voted [ unanimously ] to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate
at the existing level of 2.75 percent.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November
8 December 19, 2018:
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ]
to maintain raise the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances
at 2.20 to 2.40 percent, effective November 9 December 20, 2018. Setting
the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis
points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate is
intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within
the FOMC’s target range.
 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to
authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System
Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy
directive:
“Effective November 9 December 20, 2018, the Federal Open Market
Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as
necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to
2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations
(and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day
when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading
conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 2.25 percent, in amounts limited
only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a
per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the
amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of
Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds
$30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed
securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s

Balance Sheet and Income Projections
Here we summarize projections of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and
income statement that are consistent with the baseline forecast in Tealbook A. The
projections in this Tealbook are based on an assumption of a longer-run level of reserve
balances of $1 trillion, compared to an assumption of $500 billion in the November
Tealbook.1,2 Staff projects that this revised level of reserve balances will be reached in
the second quarter of 2020, about five quarters earlier than under the previous baseline
level.3
Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio. So far, the balance sheet normalization
program initiated in October 2017 has led to the redemption of $199 billion of Treasury
securities and $139 billion of agency securities through October 2018 (see the table in the
exhibit, “Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments”). During this
same period, reinvestments of principal payments on Treasury and agency securities were
$195 billion and $152 billion, respectively. Over the next year, redemptions of Treasury
securities and MBS are projected to total approximately $280 and $170 billion,
respectively.4 All told, total redemptions are predicted to be about $1 trillion prior to
1 Policymakers’ discussion at the November FOMC meeting suggested that many participants lean
toward implementing policy in the longer run in a regime of abundant excess reserves. The $1 trillion
figure represents a rough estimate of the level of reserve balances in an abundant-excess-reserve regime
and is based on the range of such forecasts provided by staff in the FOMC memo titled “The Federal
Reserve’s Long-Run Operating Regime” (November 2018). The figure includes a buffer to accommodate
volatility in autonomous factors that affect the level of reserves and in banks’ reserve demand, as well as a
cushion to allow for potential frictions in the redistribution of reserves.
2 Other unchanged noteworthy assumptions about liability items underlying the projections are as
follows: The Treasury General Account is assumed to increase in line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve
notes in circulation are assumed to increase at an average annual pace of about 6 percent through 2020 and
at the same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of
designated financial market utilities remain at their average October 2018 levels of approximately
$225 billion and $60 billion, respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to remain at
its October 2018 average of about $5 billion until reserve balances reach $1.5 trillion, at which point take-
up declines to zero over the subsequent year.
3 Generally speaking, the size of the balance sheet normalizes when reserves fall to their longer-
run level and purchases of Treasury securities resume keeping pace with the expansion of key non-reserve
liability items.
4 No further reinvestments of agency securities are projected to occur and future reinvestments of
principal from maturing Treasury securities will take place primarily in the middle month of each quarter
(see the bottom panel in the exhibit, “Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments”).
However, the projections for agency securities are subject to considerable uncertainty because of
unscheduled prepayments.

normalization, with Treasury and agency securities comprising about $600 billion and
$380 billion, respectively (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet
Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).
When the size of the balance sheet is normalized, the SOMA portfolio is projected
to be a touch less than $3.3 trillion, consisting of about $1.9 trillion in Treasury securities
and $1.4 trillion in agency securities. At that time, the size of the balance sheet is
projected to stand at roughly 16 percent of nominal GDP, with non-reserve liabilities
totaling 11 percent of nominal GDP. For comparison, the size of the balance sheet as a
share of nominal GDP peaked at about 25 percent in 2014 and averaged about 6 percent
prior to the crisis. After the size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will
begin to rise, keeping pace with the increases in Federal Reserve liabilities—including
Federal Reserve notes in circulation and the Treasury General Account (TGA)—as well
as Federal Reserve Bank capital.
The share of agency MBS in the portfolio, which currently stands at 42 percent, is
expected to rise slightly in the near term, reflecting the faster pace of Treasury roll-offs.
This share begins to decline once the size of the balance sheet normalizes and reaches
25 percent at the end of 2024.
SOMA portfolio characteristics. The weighted-average duration of the SOMA
Treasury portfolio is currently about six years (see the top panel of the exhibit titled
“Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings”). This
measure is projected to increase until mid-2020 as redemptions continue and longer-
duration securities become a larger share of the portfolio. After normalization of the size
of the balance sheet in 2020, the duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to
decline as the Desk adds Treasury bills to the portfolio when non-reserve liabilities grow
and securities mature.5 Once Treasury bills are one-third of the Federal Reserve’s
Treasury securities portfolio, close to their pre-crisis share, further purchases of Treasury
securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom panel of
the exhibit).6
5 The FOMC memo titled “SOMA Portfolio Composition” (December 2018) explores two
alternative Treasury compositions.
6 Excluding securities acquired through small-value test operations, the SOMA portfolio currently
contains no Treasury bills.

Federal Reserve remittances. Remittances to the Treasury are projected to
decline to $65 billion this year from $81 billion in 2017, primarily reflecting the increases
in the interest rate paid on reserve balances in 2018 (see the “Income Projections”
exhibit).7 Total interest expense is projected to rise by $14 billion, to $43 billion, this
year.8 In addition, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings this year results in a slight
decrease in projected interest income to $112 billion. A similar pattern holds going
forward. Remittances are expected to decline further and to bottom out at $37 billion in
2020. Thereafter, remittances rise due to an increase in interest income associated with a
growing balance sheet. The projected path for remittances is similar to that in the
November Tealbook. As shown in the bottom left panel of the “Income Projections”
exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the
projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis average.
Unrealized gains or losses. The SOMA portfolio was in a net unrealized loss
position of about $105 billion at the end of October.9 With longer-term interest rates
expected to rise further over the next few years, the unrealized loss position is expected to
peak at $241 billion in 2020:Q2. Of this amount, $100 billion is attributable to Treasury
securities and $141 billion to agency MBS. The unrealized loss position subsequently
narrows, as securities acquired under the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase
programs approach maturity. The net unrealized loss position is projected to be a bit
smaller in the near term compared to the November Tealbook.
Term premium effect. SOMA securities held as a result of the Federal Reserve’s
asset purchase programs are currently estimated to be reducing the term premium in the
10-year Treasury yield by about 78 basis points (see the table, “Projections for the 10-
7 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus. First, $2.5 billion was transferred in February 2018 following an
amendment to Section 7 of the Federal Reserve Act by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in that
month. Second, $675 million was transferred in June 2018, reflecting another amendment to Section 7 by
the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in May 2018.
8 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25-basis-point-wide target range for the federal
funds rate throughout the projection period. Consistent with the FOMC’s November Implementation Note,
we assume that the interest rates paid on reserve balances will be set five basis points below the top of the
target range. We continue to assume that the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the bottom of
the range.
9 See the Tealbook B box titled “What Does it Mean for the SOMA Portfolio to Be in an
‘Unrealized Loss’ Position?” (June 2018) for an explanation of the accounting notions of unrealized and
realized gain and loss positions, as well as their implications for the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its
obligations.

Year Treasury Term Premium Effect”). This term premium effect (or TPE) is a few basis
points larger than projected in the previous Tealbook, with the difference between the
current and previous estimates growing to about 10 basis points by 2022.10 The
difference between the two paths is due to the $500 billion increase in the assumed
longer-run level of reserves, which, in turn, leads to a larger balance sheet.
In comparison to estimates for the TPE of a $500 billion large-scale asset
purchase (LSAP) at the time of the last round of such purchases in 2012, the magnitude
of the change in the TPE path from the larger balance sheet is smaller. There are three
factors affecting the TPE compared with previous staff analyses: First, the effect of a
given dollar amount of securities holdings is scaled by nominal GDP, and nominal GDP
is now larger. Second, the LSAPs targeted long-duration assets only; this projection
assumes that the additional SOMA assets are aligned more closely with the pre-crisis
distribution of asset holdings. Taken together, these two factors imply that the TPE of
the change in the longer-run reserves assumption should be about one-third the size of the
effect of a similarly-sized LSAP in 2012. A third factor works in the opposite direction:
Whereas the securities acquired with the LSAPs were assumed to run off, the additional
portfolio holdings associated with the increased reserves assumption are permanent,
which strengthens the effect of the change in the reserves assumption. All told, the
increase in the assumption for the longer-run level of reserves is estimated to increase the
TPE by about one-half of a similarly-sized LSAP in 2012.
10 The estimated path of the TPE depends on the difference between the expected path of the
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years and a counterfactual projection based on the
configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In the
counterfactual projection, it is assumed that reserve balances reach their longer-run level at $100 billion.
