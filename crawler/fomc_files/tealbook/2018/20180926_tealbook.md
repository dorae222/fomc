Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook
&
l
e
v
e
The economy has continued to expand at a brisk pace. Real GDP is estimated to D
n
have increased 3½ percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year and is expected to o
c
E
rise at a 2¾ percent rate in the second half. GDP grows at a modestly faster pace in 2018 c
ti
s
than we had written down in the July Tealbook, with slightly higher contributions from e
m
PCE and business investment. Labor market conditions have continued to strengthen: o
D
Payroll employment has continued to increase substantially, and the unemployment rate
was 3.9 percent in July and August, unchanged from the second quarter and nearly
¾ percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate. With above-trend output
growth, the unemployment rate is expected to move down to 3.7 percent by year-end.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow steadily from 3 percent this year to
1½ percent in 2021. A gradual tightening in monetary policy explains the bulk of the
slowdown in GDP growth, but the emergence of some modest supply constraints and a
reduction in fiscal impetus in 2021 also contribute. We now estimate the output gap to
have been 1¾ percent in the second quarter of this year; with output expected to outpace
its potential through mid-2020, the output gap increases steadily and reaches 3¼ percent
in mid-2020 before edging down to 2¾ percent by the end of 2021, the same as in the
July Tealbook. We project that the unemployment rate will fall to 3¼ percent in 2020
and then edge up to nearly 3½ percent by the end of the medium term. The
unemployment rate at the end of 2021 is ¼ percentage point lower than we forecast in
July, partly because we nudged down our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment
by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.6 percent.
The 12-month change in core PCE prices is estimated to have been 1.9 percent in
August, and it is expected to remain near that level through the end of this year. Core
PCE price inflation is forecast to edge up to 2.1 percent by 2020—as labor and product
markets tighten further—and then remain there in 2021. Total PCE price inflation is
projected to run a little above core inflation through the end of this year and then to run a
touch below it thereafter, reflecting the declining path for consumer energy prices in the
medium term. As before, these projections incorporate our assumption that modest
supply constraints will result in slightly higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.
The forecast for the path of consumer prices is little different than in the July Tealbook.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
&
l
e
v The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following
e
D the June FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection
n
o with the one we presented in the June Tealbook.
c
E
c Incoming data for real GDP growth have been a bit stronger than we expected in the June
ti
e s Tealbook, although the unemployment rate has come in a touch higher. Our projection for
m
real GDP over the medium term has been revised up slightly, reflecting somewhat more
o
D
favorable trajectories for both overall financial conditions (primarily, higher equity prices)
and personal income. The medium-term forecast for the unemployment rate is revised
down a little, partly reflecting our updated assumption that the natural rate of
unemployment is 4.6 percent—0.1 percentage point lower than in the June forecast. All
told, resource utilization, as measured by the output gap or the unemployment rate gap, is
slightly tighter in our medium-term projection than in the June Tealbook.
Our forecasts for both total and core inflation in 2018 and over the medium term are little
changed relative to the June Tealbook. We continue to expect core inflation to be close to
2 percent over the next several years; total inflation is forecast to run a bit below core
inflation after this year, reflecting a small projected decline in energy prices.
The path for the federal funds rate derived from the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule
used in our baseline forecast is quite similar to its trajectory in June, although it is a bit
steeper in the medium term with the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current
projection.

Finally, we estimate that the tariffs on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from t l
u
O
China that were implemented this year, along with our trading partners’ responses to
&
l
those tariffs, will have only very small effects on net exports, overall spending, and e
v
e
aggregate consumer prices. Other tariff changes reportedly under review remain D
n
uncertain and are not included in our projection, but we estimate their effects would be o
c
E
more material. The possible effects of a broad-based increase in trade barriers are more c
ti
s
consequential still and are discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section. e

D
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS
Monetary Policy
 The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection
calls for the federal funds rate to increase ½ percentage point over the
remainder of this year, to increase 1¼ percentage points next year, and to rise,
on average, ½ percentage point per year in the remainder of the medium term,
reaching 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. This trajectory is very
similar to the one in the July Tealbook.
 The size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline in
a manner consistent with the Committee’s public declarations.
Other Interest Rates
 The 10-year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of about
3 percent in the current quarter to 4¼ percent by the end of 2021, a path that is
similar to the one in the July Tealbook.
o The funds rate is anticipated to rise above the 10-year rate in
mid-2020, the same as in the July Tealbook.
 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B corporate bond yield have
risen about as expected and are projected to rise significantly further over the
medium term, in line with the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield.
Equity Prices and Home Prices
 Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter about 2½ percent above
the July Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broad equity price
indexes. Beyond the current quarter, we forecast stock prices to rise at an

Projected future appreciation is held down by the fact that equity valuations

v
e
D
 We expect house price growth to slow from 6 percent in 2017 to 5 percent this n
o
c
year. Weaker-than-expected house price data for June and July caused us to E
c
ti
mark down the increase we project this year. We continue to expect house s
e
m
price increases to moderate to an average pace of 3½ percent over the next
o
D
three years, reflecting both the continuing rise in mortgage rates and our
assessment that house prices are elevated relative to rents.
Fiscal Policy
 We assume that the expansionary fiscal policies enacted over the past year
will continue through the medium term.1 Taking these assumptions on board,
we estimate that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels of
government will contribute ½ percentage point to the rate of growth in
aggregate demand in each year through 2020 (exclusive of any multiplier
effects and financial offsets); this contribution eases to ¼ percentage point in
2021.
 We expect the federal budget deficit to widen from 3½ percent of GDP in
fiscal year 2017 to 5½ percent in fiscal 2021 as a result of expansionary fiscal
policy and the effects of higher interest rates on debt service costs.
o We continue to assume that, in the longer run, policymakers
gradually reduce deficits by an amount sufficient to stabilize the
debt-to-GDP ratio.
o We expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to stabilize at a level
20 percentage points higher than would have occurred absent
recent and projected policy actions. We anticipate that the higher
debt-to-GDP ratio will push up the longer-run term premium on
10-year Treasury securities by 50 basis points.
1 Our forecast assumes that the current level of discretionary spending will be maintained in real
terms in fiscal years 2020 and 2021; realization of that forecast will require lifting the discretionary
spending caps for those years.

s Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar
e
m
o  Real GDP growth in the foreign economies stepped down in the second
D
quarter to an annual rate of 2 percent, as a broad-based slowing in the
emerging market economies (EMEs) was only partly offset by a rebound in
growth in some advanced foreign economies (AFEs). This estimate is
noticeably lower than in the previous Tealbook. We foresee GDP growth
abroad rising in the second half of this year to a little below its potential pace
of around 2¾ percent and remaining there over the forecast period. The
projection for the second half is somewhat weaker than in the previous
Tealbook, reflecting softer data as well as increased financial stresses abroad
(especially for some EMEs). Heightened financial pressures and recent trade
policy developments have increased downside risks to our foreign outlook.
 Since the July Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated
1¾ percent.3 We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of
1¾ percent through the forecast period as market expectations for the federal
funds rate move up toward the staff forecast. Because this rate of appreciation
is slightly less than in the July Tealbook, our projection for the real dollar at
the end of the forecast horizon is little changed.
Oil Prices
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen about $7 per barrel, on net, since
the July Tealbook, closing most recently around $80 per barrel. The increase
in prices is due partly to signals of greater foreign compliance with U.S.
2 A lapse in appropriations that resulted in a short-term shutdown of the federal government would
have only minor implications for the outlook. We estimate that each week of a government shutdown
would directly reduce GDP growth in the current quarter by 0.1 percentage point (annual rate). Assuming
government appropriations return to baseline levels in the next quarter, GDP growth would increase by the
same magnitude.
3 Excluding the 96 percent devaluation of the bolivar announced last month by the Venezuelan
government, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated only 1¼ percent.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY o
D
Real GDP is now estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 4¾ percent in
the second quarter. The strong showing reflected a rebound in consumer spending from
an inexplicably weak first quarter as well as a temporary jump in agricultural exports and
government expenditures. Smoothing through these movements, GDP growth rose at a
brisk 3½ percent pace in the first half. The incoming spending data have continued to be
strong, on net, so far this quarter, and we project that real GDP in the second half will rise
at a 2¾ percent pace, a little above our July Tealbook projection.4
 PCE rose at a 2¼ percent pace in the first half of the year, and we expect
growth to step up in the second half. Combining the strong recent gains in
retail sales and lackluster purchases of new vehicles, we see PCE goods
spending rising at a solid pace in the third quarter. The latest data on
household spending on services have also been quite strong. Although rising
interest rates may have started to curb durables spending, the combination of
the recent spending data and the solid fundamentals—rising income boosted
by tax changes, wealth gains from rising equity prices and home values, and
favorable sentiment—point to PCE growth of about 2¾ percent in the second
half of this year.
 Business fixed investment rose at a 10 percent pace in the first half of 2018,
which was in part due to an unusually swift pace of intangibles investment
and a spike in drilling investment spurred by rising oil prices. We expect that
growth in intangibles investment will moderate and that drilling investment
will flatten out in the second half of this year, but that business fixed
4 The numerical forecast that accompanies this document was closed before the August retail sales
report was available; that report was noticeably stronger than we had factored in and would boost our third-
quarter GDP growth estimate by a little less than ½ percentage point. Our forecast update next Friday will
incorporate these data as well as our preliminary assessment of the economic effects of Hurricane Florence.

investment will rise at a still-solid pace of 5¾ percent. More broadly, t l

business investment is being supported by solid business output growth,

ample access to financing, continued upbeat readings on business sentiment, e

e
buoyant profit expectations, and the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. D

c
 Residential investment declined at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the first E
c
ti
half of this year, reflecting the drag from rising mortgage rates and supply s
e
m
constraints in the construction sector. Forward-looking indicators—including
o
D
construction permits for single-family homes, pending home sales, and the
Michigan survey index of homebuying conditions—have generally softened in
recent months, on net, and we expect investment to continue to decline
through the remainder of 2018.
 After making a sizable positive contribution to real GDP growth in the second
quarter, net exports are expected to subtract about ½ percentage point from
growth in the second half of this year. The net export contribution in the
second half is ¼ percentage point more negative relative to the July Tealbook,
reflecting stronger-than-expected third-quarter imports, which do not appear
to be in anticipation of prospective tariffs. Our projection for foreign trade in
coming quarters includes the effects of the already implemented trade policy
actions, including the aluminum and steel tariffs, tariffs on $50 billion worth
of imports from China, and reciprocal actions by our trading partners.
Because the negative effects on export and import growth are offsetting, the
trade policy measures are projected to have little effect on the overall
contribution of net exports to real GDP growth.
 Manufacturing production picked up in July and August to a 3 percent annual
rate after rising 2¼ percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year.
Readings on new orders from manufacturing surveys remain upbeat.
Although we estimate that light vehicle assemblies moved up, on net, in July
and August, automakers’ production schedules suggest production in the
second half of the year will move sideways from the first half of the year at
10.8 million units. All told, manufacturing production is expected to pick up
to a 2¾ percent pace in the second half.
For the medium term, we project that real GDP growth will slow roughly
½ percentage point per year, from about 3 percent this year to 1½ percent in 2021. The

 Our forecast for real GDP is a little stronger than in the July Tealbook, e
D
n
primarily reflecting the effects of incoming data on business investment and a o

higher path for household income. Meanwhile, changes in financial market
c

conditions and oil prices had little effect on the projection. s

o
D
 In the comprehensive revision to the national accounts, the BEA revised up
the level of disposable personal income substantially over history, with
particularly large revisions in 2016 and 2017. We took some signal from the
recent income revisions and nudged up our PCE forecast. Nevertheless, the
revisions to income result in a markedly higher level of the saving rate over
history that carries into the projection period.
 In the wake of the BEA’s comprehensive update to the national income and
product accounts (NIPA), we re-evaluated our aggregate supply assumptions.
Specifically, we lowered our natural rate estimate one-tenth to 4.6 percent,
and we raised our estimate of the trend labor force participation rate by a little
over 0.1 percentage point. Combined with some other housekeeping changes,
these adjustments resulted in an output gap that was still sizable but
¼ percentage point smaller at midyear than we had previously shown.
o Near the most recent two business cycle peaks, we had become too
optimistic about our supply-side assumptions and later reversed
some of that optimism. To take out some insurance against a
repetition of that mistake, we have moved cautiously in this cycle
in adjusting downward our assumption for the natural rate despite
the low-inflation, low-unemployment environment. However,
with the benefit of the comprehensive revision, we assessed that a
small further adjustment was warranted.
o At the same time, the participation rate has surprised us
persistently on the upside over the past year, and the adjustment to
the LFPR trend is an attempt to address this regularity.

e s THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET
m
o
D The July and August employment reports indicated that labor market conditions
have continued to strengthen about as we had expected. The unemployment rate was
3.9 percent in both July and August, down 0.2 percentage point from the end of 2017,
while the labor force participation rate (LFPR) averaged 62.8 percent during the past two
months and has been little changed, on balance, over the past four years.
 According to the BLS, private nonfarm payrolls increased 204,000 in August
and about 180,000 per month over the most recent three months—a slightly
smaller three-month change than we had expected, owing to downward
revisions to earlier months. In response, we nudged down our near-term
projection for private nonfarm payroll gains 10,000 per month to an average
of 180,000, still well above the pace we estimate to be required to maintain
unchanged resource utilization.
 Data that we analyze from the payroll processing firm ADP (see the figure
“Labor Market Developments and Outlook”) point to an average increase in
private payrolls over the three months ending in August of about 260,000. A
model-based estimate that combines the information from the BLS and ADP
data currently shows the number of private jobs as having increased 220,000
per month over the past three months.
 We continue to project that the unemployment rate will move down further to
3.7 percent by the end of this year, a little less than 1 percentage point below
our estimate of its natural rate.
 The LFPR fell to 62.7 percent in August, 0.1 percentage point below our
previous forecast. Because the dip was concentrated in 16-to-24-year-olds’
LFPRs (which are especially volatile near the start of the school year), we are
inclined to discount the August reading. Thus, we project the aggregate LFPR
Page 16 of 138

o
o
will edge back up to 62.8 percent in September and remain at that level t l
u
O
through the end of the year, unchanged from the July Tealbook. The LFPR is
&
l
now ¼ percentage point above the trend estimated by the staff. The e
v
e
employment-to-population ratio averaged 60.4 percent over the past two D
n
months, in line with our July Tealbook forecast, and is ¾ percentage point o
c
E
above our estimate of its trend. c
ti
s
e
m
 The BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for July also points to an
o
D
extremely tight labor market—for example, the job openings rate for private-
sector employment was reported to be 4.7 percent, a 0.3 percentage point
increase from a year earlier and the highest rate recorded in the 18-year
history of the series.
We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further over the medium term,
consistent with above-trend GDP growth. We also continue to assume that, in an
extremely tight labor market, a larger-than-usual amount of the tightening in resource
utilization will manifest in a higher LFPR and a smaller-than-usual amount in a lower
unemployment rate.
 Average monthly total payroll gains slow gradually in the projection, from
about 180,000 in the second half of this year to about 90,000 in 2021. The
box “Sources of Strong Employment Growth in the Staff Forecast” considers
how the staff’s payroll forecast can be achieved given the current very tight
labor market.
 The unemployment rate is projected to move down to 3.3 percent by the
middle of next year and slip a touch further to 3.2 percent in 2020. We
anticipate some softening in the labor market in 2021 and expect the
unemployment rate to edge up to 3.4 percent by the end of that year—still
1¼ percentage points below its natural rate.
 The LFPR is expected to increase to 62.9 percent in 2019 and then decline
gradually in 2020 and 2021. With the trend participation rate expected to
continue to decline, we project that the LFPR gap will widen from
0.3 percentage point at the end of 2018 to 0.6 percentage point at the end of
2020 before narrowing to 0.5 percentage point by the end of 2021.

Sources of Strong Employment Growth in the Staff Forecast &
l
e
v
e
The staff projects that the labor market will tighten further through the end of D
n
2020, with payroll employment rising by nearly 5 million from 2018:Q2 to
o
c
2020:Q4—about 2 million more than our estimate of its neutral pace (the pace of E
c
job gains needed to maintain labor utilization at its current level).1 With the labor ti
s
market already quite tight, how might the strong job growth in the staff forecast e
m
be achieved? o
D
The staff expects that about half of these job gains will come from further
increases in the labor force. In particular, the labor force participation rate
(LFPR) is projected to be about flat, on net, through the end of 2020 even as the
staff’s estimate of its trend declines almost 0.2 percentage point per year. The
remainder of the above-trend job growth is manifest in a further 0.6 percentage
point decline in the unemployment rate, to 3.2 percent by 2020:Q4. The
important role played by the LFPR relative to the unemployment rate in the staff
forecast contrasts with the typical pattern in which a greater portion of job gains
are met by reductions in the unemployment rate and reflects the staff’s
judgment that unusually abundant job openings and rising wages will draw new
workers into the labor force and discourage others from leaving.
1 The staff estimates that the neutral pace of payroll job gains through the medium term is
roughly 95,000 per month. This estimate assumes that the unemployment rate remains at its
2018:Q2 value of 3.9 percent, that the LFPR declines in parallel with its trend (about
0.2 percentage point per year), and that the gains in employment as measured in the
establishment survey exceed the gains in employment as measured in the household survey by
about 15,000 per month (similar to the differential of the past few years and in the staff
forecast through 2020).

O
How might these further increases in the labor force occur? Over the projection
&
l period, the staff estimates that population aging will continue to exert
e
v
e downward pressure on the LFPR. For the LFPR to remain about flat despite a
D
larger share of the population moving into age groups with lower LFPRs, there
n
o
must be offsetting increases in the LFPRs for some age groups. The staff does
c
E
not explicitly forecast demographic-specific LFPRs, but it is useful to consider
c
s
ti
whether there is a reasonable combination of improvements in age-specific
e
m LFPRs that is consistent with the staff’s projection for the aggregate LFPR. The
o
D dashed lines in figure 1 show one possible such combination of assumptions for
the 16–24, 25–54, 55–64, and 65+ age groups, with the LFPR for each group
increasing a little more than ½ percentage point from 2018:Q2 to 2020:Q4—
roughly a continuation of their increases since 2014.
Is this scenario reasonable? It leaves the LFPRs for the 16-to-24-year-old group
and the 25-to-54-year-old group below pre-recession levels and the LFPRs for
older individuals above pre-recession levels; for all of these groups, these
outcomes are broadly consistent with multidecade trends before the recession.
The secular decline in the LFPR for 16-to-24-year-olds before the recession
reflected primarily a rise in school enrollment and a decline in labor force
participation among students, while the decline for 25-to-54-year-olds partly
reflected reduced demand for lower-skilled workers (due to, for example,
globalization and automation) and rising disability rates.2 A return to pre-
recession levels for these groups seems unlikely because many of these factors
have continued to exert some downward influence over the past decade and
probably will continue to do so even in a tight labor market.3 Meanwhile, rising
longevity and better health outcomes in the older age groups have helped push
up their LFPRs for many decades before the recession, and some continuation of
this trend seems likely.
As for the unemployment rate, how might the labor market achieve an additional
0.6 percentage point decline, as in the staff forecast? The dashed lines in figure 2
show one possible combination of improvements to the job-finding rate out of
unemployment and the job-separation rate into unemployment (modified to take
into account flows into and out of the labor force; see the note in figure 2) that
2 For the decline in labor force participation among 16-to-24-year-olds, see Teresa L. Morisi
(2017), “Teen Labor Force Participation in the Great Recession and Beyond,” Monthly Labor
Review, February, https://doi.org/10.21916/mlr.2017.5; for the decline among 25-to-54-year-olds,
see Katharine G. Abraham and Melissa S. Kearney (2018), “Explaining the Decline in the U.S.
Employment-to-Population Ratio: A Review of the Evidence,” NBER Working Paper Series
24333 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, February),
http://www.nber.org/papers/w24333.
3 If, instead, all of the improvement in the aggregate LFPR were to come from an increase
in the LFPR for the 25-to-54-year-old group, then the LFPR for this age group would have to rise
another ½ percentage point, putting it close to its pre-recession level.

together lead to a 3.2 percent unemployment rate in 2020:Q4. In this scenario,
&
we assume that the recent pace of improvement in the job-finding and job- l
e
v
separation rates roughly continues through 2020. e
D
n
o
Are these improvements in the job-finding and job-separation rates plausible?
c
E
Because the job-finding rate is currently below the level seen during the late
c
1990s, it seems likely that at least some of the adjustment will come from the job- s
ti
e
finding margin, as firms attempt to fill vacancies by relaxing job requirements m
o
and hiring standards, or offering training opportunities to less-qualified hires. D
Although the job-separation rate is already at a historical low, this low level may
reflect structural as well cyclical factors.4 Moreover, in previous tight labor
markets such as the late 1990s, falling separation rates contributed importantly
to declines in unemployment. We conclude that these improvements in job-
finding and job-separation rates are indeed plausible.
4 The declining labor force share of 16-to-24-year-olds (who have a higher-than-average
job-separation rate) and the rising labor force share of college-educated workers (who have a
lower-than-average job-separation rate) have exerted downward pressure on separation rates
over the past few decades and will likely continue doing so.

e s THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
m
o
D With the CPI and PPI for August now in hand, we estimate that core PCE prices
increased 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in August, in line with our July
Tealbook forecast and up substantially from 1.4 percent one year ago. We expect core
inflation will remain around 1.9 percent through the end of the year. Total PCE prices
are estimated to have increased 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, boosted
by increases in consumer energy prices in August and earlier in the year. We expect the
12-month change in total PCE prices to move down to 2.0 percent in September and to
remain there through the end of the year.
 Our near-term projection for core price inflation is little revised. The PCE
price data for July were a little higher than expected, but the CPI data for
August were lower. However, we made some small upward adjustments in
response to tariff policy developments and the latest annual announcement of
Medicare payment rates for hospitals.5
 Core import prices increased at an average annual rate of 1½ percent in the
first half of the year but are expected to reverse that increase over the second
half as recent dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices reduce import
prices.6 Thereafter, import price inflation is expected to turn positive again,
averaging ¾ percent from 2019 to 2021, consistent with moderate foreign
inflation and an only gradually appreciating dollar.
5 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have proposed a large increase in Medicare
inpatient hospital payments for the fiscal year beginning in October that would result in a one-time increase
in the level of prices and hence no lasting effect on the rate of inflation. With regard to import prices, U.S.
tariffs have been implemented this year on a set of goods accounting for approximately $100 billion in
imports in 2017. Additional tariff increases are currently under consideration.
6 Although the effective prices paid by purchasers of imported goods will include the effects of
tariffs, import price indexes are measured excluding tariffs. The contribution of the tariffs implemented so
far this year to the rate of change in these effective prices over 2018:H2 is estimated to be at most
1 percentage point at an annual rate.

 Crude oil and retail gasoline prices have moved up somewhat faster than we t l
u
O
projected in the July Tealbook, and we raised our PCE energy price forecast in
&
l
the second half of the year in response. We anticipate consumer energy prices e
v
e
will rise 6.5 percent this year and then decline modestly over the next three D
n
years. With regard to food prices, the incoming data have been a bit weaker o
c
E
than expected. We partially offset the downward misses in light of c
ti
s
announcements of selected packaged food and beverage price increases in e
m
response to increased tariffs on steel and aluminum; overall, these effects are o
D
modest, and our food price inflation forecast is little revised in the medium
term.7
 Readings on longer-term inflation expectations have changed little since the
July Tealbook and, on balance, suggest that expectations remain well
anchored. In the preliminary September report from the University of
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the median of inflation expectations over
the next 5 to 10 years was 2.4 percent, within the narrow range occupied in
recent years.
We still project that core inflation will move up gradually to 2.1 percent in 2020
and 2021, reflecting the upward pressure on prices from elevated rates of resource
utilization and an upward drift in trend inflation. Total PCE price inflation is projected to
run slightly below core inflation after this year, reflecting the declining path for consumer
energy prices in the medium term. As before, these projections are predicated on our
assumption that modest supply constraints will give a slight boost to inflation over the
next few years. Our medium-term outlook for total and core PCE price inflation is
unchanged relative to the July Tealbook.
We continue to forecast that strong labor market conditions will bring about a
further step-up in the growth of hourly compensation.
 Average hourly earnings of all employees increased 2.9 percent over the
12 months ending in August, above our July Tealbook expectations, and the
highest 12-month increase since 2009.
7 Soda and beer producers, in particular, have announced price increases in response to the rising
cost of aluminum cans attributed to higher tariffs on aluminum imports.

v 13 percent in the early 1980s to about 8 percent in 2015, according to the Business Dynamics
e
D Statistics (BDS) data shown in figure 1. In part, the decline appears to reflect a longer-run
n
o downward trend in business formations that can be partially attributed to demographic change.1
c
E Moreover, there was also a steep decline in start-ups during the financial crisis that has yet to be
c reversed: The start-up rate declined more than 25 percent from 2006 to 2010, resulting in a
ti
e s “missing generation” of firms.2
m
o
D
While start-ups in any given year account for only about 3 percent of aggregate employment,
research suggests that changes in new business formation have had important consequences for
employment, real GDP, and productivity growth over time.3 For example, state-level data from
1980 to 2013 indicate that a 1 percent increase in the start-up rate is associated with a
contemporaneous increase in real GDP per capita of about 0.1 percent that persists over time. A
25 percent decline in start-ups would thus lead to a 2.5 percent decline in real GDP per capita.4
Similarly, metropolitan areas with larger declines in business formation during the recession had
more gradual recoveries in employment, output, and wages from 2010 to 2014 (figure 2).5
1 See Fatih Karahan, Benjamin Pugsley, and Aysegul Sahin (2018), “Demographic Origins of the Startup
Deficit,” working paper, May.
2 Start-ups, as well as young and small firms, were adversely affected by both the decline in aggregate
demand and by a steep reduction in the supply of credit during the financial crisis. See, for example, Michael
Siemer (forthcoming), “Employment Effects of Financial Constraints during the Great Recession,” Review of
Economics and Statistics.
3 See, for example, Titan Alon, David Berger, Robert Dent, and Benjamin Pugsley (2018), “Older and Slower:
The Startup Deficit’s Lasting Effects on Aggregate Productivity Growth,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 93
(September), pp. 68–85.
4 See François Gourio, Todd Messer, and Michael Siemer (2016), “Firm Entry and Macroeconomic Dynamics: A
State-Level Analysis,” American Economic Review, vol. 106 (May), pp. 214–18.
5 The decline in business formation during the financial crisis predicts local employment per capita growth
after the financial crisis even after controlling for a large number of other potential explanatory factors, such as
the depth of the recession, the declines in house prices and small business lending during the recession, the

With respect to the aggregate implications of the decline in business formation, a preliminary
estimate suggests that if business formation had remained at its 2007 level, then more than
2 million additional jobs may have been created from 2010 to 2014.6 The intuition behind this
finding is that start-ups tend to grow faster than older firms and thus contribute significantly to
both gross and net job creation. 7 Therefore, a “missing generation” of start-ups can have a
persistent negative effect on the economy. Moreover, a new data set associated with recent
research linking applications for employer identification numbers to future business formations
suggests that business formation remained low through mid-2018.8
Economic research regarding the importance of business formation for economic growth is
relatively new and rapidly evolving. Moreover, the above findings suggest that the lack of a
substantial recovery in business formation may restrain future economic and productivity growth.
What are the implications of the decline in business dynamism for monetary policymakers? The
trend decline in business formation may point to ongoing slow growth in potential output that, in
turn, will be associated with a low longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate. Whether
business formation indeed remains low is therefore one key point of uncertainty regarding the
future performance of the economy.
growth of the gig economy, and the size of new start-ups. Data on business formation at the metropolitan area
level from the BDS are only available until 2014.
6 This partial-equilibrium estimate takes into account that other aforementioned factors may have affected
the economic recovery. The estimate does not take into account that, in the absence of the decline in business
formation, other factors, such as wages and prices, would likely have adjusted.

versus Young,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 95 (May), pp. 347–61.

 Compensation per hour (CPH) in the business sector increased 3.3 percent t l
u
O
over the year ending in the second quarter, about three-tenths higher than we
&
l
expected in the July Tealbook. We project that CPH will accelerate to a e
v
e
roughly 4 percent pace for 2019 through 2021. (CPH was revised appreciably D

 Over the four quarters ending in June, the ECI for private-sector workers o
D
increased 2.9 percent. Given its relatively muted cyclical sensitivity, the ECI
is projected to accelerate less than the compensation per hour measure and to
reach only 3.0 percent in the medium term.
 The July reading from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth
Tracker was 3.3 percent, within the range seen in the past year.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK
 We have revised down our assumption about the natural rate of
unemployment in the longer run to 4.6 percent, in line with the revision to the
natural rate in the medium term. We continue to assume that potential output
growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the longer run.
 We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent. The nominal yield on
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the longer run.
The term premium gradually rises toward 90 basis points in the longer run,
lifted in part by the elevated level of federal debt.
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to
put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, though to a diminishing
extent over time. The SOMA portfolio is expected to be at a normal size and
composition by mid-2021.
 With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows to slightly above 1 percent
from 2022 to 2024, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level and the
boost to growth from fiscal policy fades. The unemployment rate moves up
gradually from 3½ percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate

International Economic Developments and Outlook
The outlook for the U.S. and foreign economies appears to be diverging following
the more buoyant, synchronized global expansion that characterized the turn of the year.
In the United States, a sizable and growing positive output gap is projected for most of
the forecast period. In contrast, the foreign output gap is projected to remain near zero
over the forecast period, as foreign economic growth is projected to remain solid but only
a bit above potential. Moreover, since the start of this year, we have been revising down
our outlook for growth abroad even as the U.S. outlook has strengthened. Finally, in the
k
o
face of a ratcheting up of financial stresses in emerging market economies (EMEs) and o
l
t
u
political uncertainties in Europe, downside risks to the foreign outlook have increased.
O
&
l
e
We estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs will step up from a downwardly v
e
D
revised 1.6 percent in the second quarter to 3¼ percent in the third as export growth
n
o
across the EMEs recovers from a temporary dip and as other temporary headwinds c
E
l
(including a nationwide truckers’ strike in Brazil) dissipate. In the advanced foreign t ’
n
I
economies (AFEs), we estimate that growth will slow from 2.4 percent to 1¾ percent as
Canadian and Japanese growth moderate from an unusually rapid pace. All told, foreign
GDP growth is projected to step up from 2.0 percent in the second quarter to 2½ percent
in the third quarter, close to its potential rate.
Continuing the trend of downward revisions to our foreign outlook, recent
indicators suggest that the third-quarter pickup will be somewhat weaker than anticipated
in the July Tealbook, and we also marked down somewhat the foreign growth outlook
over the next few quarters. The revision reflects weaker-than-expected data in the EMEs
as well as our view that heightened financial stresses will weigh on EME growth,
especially in the more vulnerable economies where central banks are tightening monetary
policy in response to capital flight or inflationary pressures. The recent weakening of
EME currencies has bolstered AFE currencies on a trade-weighted basis, which led us to
revise down AFE growth a touch in the near term.
As discussed in the box “Financial Stresses in Turkey and Argentina,” financial
stresses have so far been concentrated in a few highly vulnerable EMEs; spillovers to less
vulnerable EMEs have been relatively modest. Accordingly, the effect of these stresses
on our baseline projection of overall foreign growth has been small. However, the recent

Financial Stresses in Turkey and Argentina
In an environment of rising U.S. interest rates, a strengthening dollar, and more risky, less buoyant
conditions in Europe, prospects for EMEs are coming under increasing investor scrutiny. In particular,
given already high domestic vulnerabilities, Turkey and Argentina experienced intense financial pressure
over the intermeeting period. In Turkey, credit spreads widened sharply, and the Turkish lira depreciated
19 percent against the dollar from the time of the July FOMC meeting (panel 1 of the figure). In Argentina,
despite an IMF program initiated in June, the Argentine peso fell 31 percent against the dollar, and
sovereign spreads widened (panel 2). Though developments in these countries were accompanied by
some deterioration of financial conditions in other EMEs, they have been driven largely by homegrown
problems, and our baseline view is that spillovers to other markets and to the U.S. economy will likely be
limited. That said, downside risks of more widespread problems in the EMEs have decidedly increased.
k
o
o In Turkey, although the proximate trigger was escalating tensions with the United States over Turkish
l
u t prosecution of a U.S. pastor, recent market pressures reflect pronounced macroeconomic vulnerabilities.
O
Overly stimulative monetary and lending policies have led to a credit-fueled overheating of the economy
&
and have pushed up inflation to 18 percent, well above the central bank’s 5 percent target. As of 2017, the
l
e
v current account deficit had widened to about 6 percent of GDP, and short-term external debt had
e
D
surpassed 20 percent of GDP. Much of this external debt is owed by Turkish banks, which have relied on
n
o wholesale foreign-currency funding from abroad. Despite having off-balance-sheet currency hedges,
c
E banks are nonetheless exposed to default risk on foreign-currency loans they extended to Turkish
l
t ’ corporates.1 These loans, together with debt issued in international markets, have swollen foreign-
n
I
currency-denominated liabilities of Turkish nonfinancial corporations to nearly 40 percent of GDP.
Against the background of President Erdoğan’s stated preference for keeping interest rates low, the
central bank’s failure until very recently to tighten monetary policy appreciably in the face of rising
inflation and financial turmoil intensified concerns about the economy.
On September 13, 2018, the Turkish central bank acted more forcefully, raising its benchmark policy rate
650 basis points, and the Turkish lira appreciated significantly following this move. These developments
could presage a more persistent improvement in investor sentiment. However, Turkey’s problems run
deep, and President Erdoğan adamantly opposes seeking IMF support. As such, we see protracted
financial stresses and recession in Turkey as likely.
Argentina’s economy has also faltered, as a severe drought has exacerbated rising domestic
macroeconomic imbalances. Despite the installment of President Macri’s market-friendly government in
2015, a high fiscal deficit partly monetized by the central bank, growing public external debt, a large
current account deficit, and only gradual fiscal tightening in the face of very high inflation have led to a
loss of investor confidence and capital outflows. Unlike Turkish authorities, the Argentine government
sought support from the IMF and is attempting to implement orthodox policies under the program
(including fiscal tightening). Moreover, in light of the further slide in financial conditions since the
program was agreed to, the Macri government has further tightened its fiscal target for the primary
deficit to zero next year, and the central bank has sharply raised the policy rate. Nevertheless, the
pressure on Argentine assets has abated only a little, given high sovereign indebtedness and Argentina’s
1Default risk of domestic-currency loans, which are funded via swaps of external funds, pressures banks’ balance sheets.
Rollover risk of short-term foreign-currency hedges adds to pressures on banks.

bitter history with global financial markets. As with Turkey, we see Argentina continuing to struggle, its
situation complicated by the prospect of popular opposition to austerity ahead of next year’s elections.
Financial conditions in other vulnerable economies have also come under pressure. For example, the
currencies of Brazil, India, and South Africa have depreciated significantly in recent weeks. However,
investors still appear to be differentiating across EMEs in line with their relative macroeconomic
vulnerabilities (panel 3).
Despite the grave outlook for Turkey and Argentina, we see limited spillovers to the United States. Direct
exposures of U.S. financial institutions to these countries are small, and the real-economy links are
limited. Combined, Turkey and Argentina account for about 1 percent of U.S. total exports; U.S. banks’
exposures to Turkey represent only 1½ percent of tier 1 capital, and their exposure to Argentina is
k
negligible. Some European banks have larger credit exposures to Turkey (panel 4), and European bank o
o
stocks have suffered as a consequence, but these exposures appear to be manageable. l
t
u
O
That said, there is some risk that in the context of global policy normalization, further deterioration in &
l
these two economies or elsewhere could cause more widespread stress in EMEs. Were these e
v
developments to transpire, there could be significant adverse repercussions for the U.S. economy, as e
D
discussed in the “EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario. Moreover, the instability in n
o
Turkey poses geopolitical risks. A further worsening in its relations with the West could damage the c
E
cooperation between the European Union and Turkey on the more than 3 million Syrian refugees Turkey l
’
t
has been hosting. A potential flow of refugees to Europe could, in turn, intensify political divisions there. n

financial market volatility could presage more dire outcomes, and downside risks have
become more prominent. First, rising global interest rates and heightened market focus
on vulnerabilities in some EMEs (including sizable corporate debt burdens) could trigger
a sharper and more widespread deterioration of financial conditions. This possibility is
explored in our “EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in the Risks
and Uncertainty section. Second, populist fiscal policies in Italy could further intensify
concerns about Italian public debt sustainability, exerting greater drag on euro-area
growth than anticipated in our baseline. Third, with Brexit scheduled to occur in March
2019, if British and European Union (EU) authorities fail to reach a deal, significant
disruptions of European economic and financial market activity could result. Finally,
k
o
o ongoing trade tensions could lead to much more widespread and sustained increases in
l
t
u trade barriers than in our baseline, which incorporates only the relatively modest
O
& measures already implemented. This possibility is discussed in the “Higher Trade
l
e
v Barriers” alternative scenarios.
e
D
n
o
c Although headline inflation is estimated to have risen in the third quarter across
E
’ l all major AFEs because of higher energy prices, underlying inflation remains quite
t
n
I subdued in the euro area and Japan. With inflation expected to be noticeably below
target over the next few years, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of
Japan (BOJ) are assumed to wait until late 2019 and late 2020, respectively, to begin
raising policy rates. Even with core inflation projected to run slightly above 2 percent in
their economies for some time, the Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Canada
(BOC) are expected to normalize policy only slowly.
In the EMEs, headline inflation is estimated to have stepped up to 4½ percent in
the third quarter, reflecting higher energy prices in several countries and higher food
prices in China and Mexico. In response to rising inflationary pressures, capital outflows,
and currency depreciation, central banks in some vulnerable EMEs––including India,
Indonesia, and the Philippines––tightened monetary policy, with central banks in crisis-
ravaged Argentina and Turkey raising their policy rates more sharply. In contrast, in
more resilient EMEs such as South Korea and Taiwan, central banks have maintained
highly accommodative policies, and we see them normalizing policy gradually.
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES
• Euro area. Real GDP growth edged down from 1.6 percent in the first quarter to
1.5 percent in the second. Recent indicators, such as PMIs through August, suggest
Page 44 of 138

--- Page 48 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 14, 2018
that growth should remain around this pace in the third quarter. We also see growth
continuing through 2021 at around 1½ percent, a touch faster than potential, as
monetary policy remains highly accommodative. This projection is slightly weaker
than in the July Tealbook, largely reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro (on a
trade-weighted basis) and higher oil prices. We assume that periodic bouts of
financial stress in Italy will continue to weigh on activity in that country and, to a
lesser extent, other euro-area countries. In August, inconsistent statements by senior
Italian officials intensified concerns that the government will flout EU rules calling
for fiscal consolidation. In response, Italian government bond yields rose sharply,
prompting senior Italian officials to pledge to contain fiscal deficits. The situation
k
o
remains unsettled. o
l
t
u
O
&
We estimate that a surge in retail energy prices will boost headline inflation to
l
e
2½ percent in the third quarter, while core inflation remains around 1¼ percent. v
e
D
Headline inflation should fall below 1½ percent next year, as energy prices stabilize, n
o
and then slowly edge up as resource slack is gradually eliminated. We continue to E c
l
’
assume that the ECB will cease net asset purchases by year-end, wait until late 2019 t
n
I
to begin raising its deposit rate, and then increase it to ¼ percent by late 2021.
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth picked up to 1.5 percent in the second quarter
from 0.9 percent in the first, driven by stronger domestic demand. Incoming data––
such as July industrial output––suggest that growth should edge up to 1¾ percent in
the third quarter. Brexit negotiations have yet to resolve several critical issues,
intensifying fears that the United Kingdom will exit the EU in March 2019 with no
deal in place. Even so, we continue to assume that the United Kingdom and the EU
will eventually reach an agreement that will avoid major economic and financial
disruptions. With interest rates remaining low, U.K. growth should stay slightly
above its potential rate of 1½ percent over the forecast period.
We project inflation to rise from 1.9 percent in the second quarter to 2½ percent in the
third, reflecting higher oil prices, and then to gradually edge down to 2 percent. With
the unemployment rate down to a 43-year low, the BOE raised its policy rate
¼ percentage point to ¾ percent in August. We anticipate that the BOE will
gradually raise its Bank Rate to 1¾ percent by the end of 2021, ¼ percentage point
lower than assumed in July, owing to greater Brexit-related uncertainty.

• Canada. Supported by private consumption and especially exports, real GDP growth
rebounded from 1.4 percent in the first quarter to 2.9 percent in the second. That said,
data through July indicate that exports have slowed even more sharply than expected,
suggesting that economic growth will moderate to 1¾ percent in the third quarter,
½ percentage point lower than estimated in the July Tealbook. Nevertheless,
underlying growth momentum remains solid. We see growth picking up to
2¼ percent in 2019 before declining to 1¾ percent (our estimate of potential growth)
in 2020 and 2021. Of course, ongoing negotiations over NAFTA pose some
uncertainty to this outlook.
k
o Inflation should pick up to 3 percent this quarter from 1.1 percent in the second,
o
l
t reflecting idiosyncratic increases in some core prices as well as elevated retail energy
u
O
& inflation. With oil prices projected to decline, inflation should moderate to the
l
e BOC’s target of 2 percent by late 2020. Against this background, the BOC is
v
e
D expected to raise its policy rate from 1½ percent to 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter,
n
o
gradually increase it to 3 percent by mid-2020, and keep it there through 2021.
c
E
l
’
t
n • Japan. Following a weather-related contraction at the start of the year, real GDP
I
rebounded 3 percent in the second quarter, 1½ percentage points higher than
estimated in the July Tealbook, reflecting surprisingly strong private domestic
demand. However, more-recent data have been somewhat weak; for example,
industrial production declined in July. Accordingly, we see growth moderating to a
range of ½ to 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast period, abstracting from
substantial fluctuations in the second half of 2019 due to the consumption tax hike
planned for October 2019.
Inflation is expected to swing from negative 2.3 percent in the second quarter to
positive 1¼ percent in the third, partly reflecting fluctuations in food prices. Core
inflation is also projected to rise, but only to ¼ percent. Going forward, we see
headline inflation remaining near 1 percent through 2021, as higher oil prices provide
some boost in the near term and a tight economy slowly pushes up core inflation.
With inflation well below target, we expect the BOJ to maintain a highly
accommodative stance. Although the BOJ signaled that it would allow the 10-year
Japanese government bond yield to fluctuate a bit more around zero, we expect it to
wait until the end of 2020 to lift that target range.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
• China. We estimate that growth slowed from 6½ percent in the second quarter to
about 6 percent in the third, as tighter credit conditions weighed on domestic demand.
Recent data suggest that both retail sales and investment growth have slowed notably,
with the latter reflecting a sharp deceleration of infrastructure investment amid
increased scrutiny of off-balance-sheet local government spending. In contrast,
exports have so far remained relatively strong despite rising trade tensions with the
United States. Going forward, we expect weakening external demand to be offset by
more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, with real GDP growth remaining
k
around 6 percent in 2019 and 2020. With tariffs looming on a further $200 billion o
o
l
(and perhaps even more) of U.S. imports from China, and with China poised to t
u
O
retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion of imports from the United States, the threat of an &
l
escalation of trade hostilities remains a downside risk to our forecast. e
v
e
D
n
Inflation has been subdued, partly because of past declines in food prices. With food o
c
E
prices rebounding and higher oil prices passing through to gasoline prices, inflation
l
’
t
should rise to 3¾ percent in the third quarter and then settle at 2½ percent by the end n
I
of the year.
• Other Emerging Asia. Growth slowed to a mere 2½ percent in the second quarter,
primarily because of payback from an unusually strong pace of 5½ percent in the first
quarter. The second-quarter outcome was well below our July Tealbook estimate, in
part reflecting weak exports. This weakness, along with a smaller-than-anticipated
pickup in the tech sector, suggests that third-quarter growth will recover a little less
than we expected, to 3½ percent. We expect growth to edge up to 3¾ percent in 2019
and 2020. This projection is down slightly due to somewhat tighter financial
conditions—more so in India and Indonesia, where persistent current account deficits
and other vulnerabilities have led to significant currency depreciation. Although
U.S.–China trade barriers implemented to date should have a negligible effect on
growth in other emerging Asian economies, an escalation of trade tensions is a clear
downside risk.
• Mexico. Mexican real GDP contracted 0.6 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter after growing at a 4 percent pace in the first quarter. Monthly indicators
suggest that investment (especially residential investment) was particularly weak, and
manufacturing exports were surprisingly flat despite strong U.S. demand. However,
Page 47 of 138

--- Page 51 ---

Authorized for Public Release
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 14, 2018
more-recent data, including resilient manufacturing PMIs and surging consumer
confidence, have been more upbeat. Accordingly, we see growth moving up to nearly
3 percent by mid-2019, supported by robust U.S. demand. That said, because of the
weak second-quarter data and the recent tightening in financial conditions, we have
marked down growth about ½ percentage point in the current quarter and by a touch
over the medium term.
Headline inflation moved up to nearly 5 percent on a 12-month basis in August,
boosted by rising food and energy prices. Concerned that inflation has been
persistently well above the 3 percent target, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) decided in
k
o August to maintain its policy rate at 7¾ percent, notwithstanding the weak second
o
t l quarter. As inflation returns to its target and concerns about capital flight moderate,
u
O
the BOM is projected to begin easing monetary policy in mid-2019.
&
l
e
v
e • Brazil. Partly because of the disruptions from the nationwide truckers’ strike in May,
D
n
the Brazilian economy grew at a tepid ¾ percent pace in the second quarter.
o
c
E
Household demand was weak, investment dropped, and exports plummeted. Recent
l
’
t
n data on industrial production and exports suggest that activity has since recovered
I
from the strike. Accordingly, we see growth rebounding in the third quarter and
averaging nearly 2¾ percent in 2019. Relative to the July Tealbook, we marked
down growth over the next year in response to tighter financial conditions and greater
political uncertainty related to the October presidential election. Uncertainty about
prospects for Brazil is unusually high due to the pressing need for pension reform and
grave doubts about the ability of any of the leading presidential candidates to
achieve it.
We estimate that headline inflation jumped from 4.3 percent in the second quarter to
6¼ percent in the third, reflecting currency depreciation and the lagged effects of
disruptions from the truckers’ strike. As the transitory effects of the strike dissipate,
we expect inflation to fall in the fourth quarter before settling at 4¼ percent, the
government’s inflation target, by early next year. Despite elevated inflation, the
central bank kept rates unchanged at 6½ percent at its August meeting, citing the
weak economy and anchored inflation expectations.

Financial Market Developments
Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period,
amid ongoing concerns about trade policy, negative developments in some emerging
market economies (EMEs), and domestic economic data releases that were, on balance,
slightly stronger than expected. FOMC communications over the period were largely in
line with expectations and appear to have had little effect on asset prices. U.S. stock
prices rose, buoyed in part by positive news about corporate earnings, while global equity
indexes declined and the broad dollar index moved up.
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability of a 25 basis
point rate hike at the September FOMC meeting inched up further to near
certainty, and the likelihood of an additional hike at the December meeting
rose to about 75 percent.
 Nominal Treasury yields were little changed on net. Changes in inflation
compensation were modest and mixed, with carry-adjusted TIPS-implied
inflation compensation over the next 5 years ticking up and 5-to-10-year
inflation compensation inching down.
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 3 percent, while the VIX
s
t
e
moved down a bit. Credit spreads on both investment- and speculative-grade k
r
a
corporate bonds were little changed, on net, and remained low. M
l
a
ci
 The broad dollar index increased 1.5 percent, driven by appreciation against n
a
n
EME currencies. Broad measures of EME equity prices declined about Fi
6 percent, led by significant stress in some countries and continued
uncertainty about trade policy. Concerns about Italy and Brexit also weighed
on major advanced foreign economy (AFE) equity price indexes, which
declined 2 to 6 percent.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
FOMC communications elicited limited price reaction in financial markets over
the intermeeting period, and market-implied measures of monetary policy expectations
were little changed. Based on a straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts,

investors are currently pricing in a 98 percent probability that the FOMC will raise the
target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at its September meeting and about
a 75 percent probability of an additional hike at the December meeting. The OIS-implied
path of the federal funds rate, adjusted for term premiums using a staff model, continues
to imply that an increase totaling roughly 50 basis points is expected between now and
the end of the year.
Evolving trade-related risks and other international developments reportedly
weighed somewhat on market sentiment, especially in the early part of the intermeeting
period. However, domestic economic data releases came in a bit above market
expectations, on net, with the stronger-than-expected average hourly earnings in the
August employment report notably boosting nominal Treasury yields. On balance, the
nominal Treasury yield curve was little changed, with 2- and 10-year yields increasing 8
basis points and 1 basis point, respectively (see also the related box “Will Pension Fund
Demand for Long-Dated U.S. Treasury Securities Shift in Mid-September?”). The
spread between 10- and 2-year Treasury yields, a popular leading indicator of recessions,
now stands a bit above the 20th percentile of its distribution since 1971, while the near-
term forward spread—an arguably more precise gauge of the intermediate-term
outlook—stands near its 50th percentile.1 Uncertainty about short- and long-term interest
rates implied by interest rate derivatives remained close to the lower end of its range over
recent years.

Will Pension Fund Demand for Long‐Dated U.S. Treasury
Securities Shift in Mid‐September?
Some recent financial market commentaries have suggested that, since the
beginning of this year, domestic pension funds have increased their holdings of long‐
dated Treasury securities, putting downward pressure on long‐dated yields.
Commentaries have highlighted, in particular, U.S. corporations’ incentive to
increase contributions to their pension plans to take advantage of deductions based
on last year’s 35 percent corporate tax rate instead of the 21 percent rate for 2018
under the new tax legislation. Private pension funds can take advantage of this
deduction until 8½ months after the end of their pension plan’s fiscal year, which
will be mid‐September for firms that follow a calendar‐year plan. Some
commentaries have further speculated that when the mid‐September deadline
passes, the flow effect from the increased demand for Treasury securities may
dissipate, putting upward pressure on long‐dated yields. The discussion below
argues that a material shift in pension fund demand for longer‐dated Treasury
securities after mid‐September seems unlikely to occur.
First, available indicators do not suggest that demand for U.S. Treasury securities by
pension funds is presently elevated. Given a lack of comprehensive and timely data
on pension fund activity, financial market commentaries frequently use STRIPS
(Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) activity as a
proxy to gauge pension fund demand for U.S. Treasury securities.1 The figure shows
that STRIPS activity did rise in the first half of the year, with the total amount of
STRIPS outstanding increasing in the first and second quarters. However, the figure

1 STRIPS are Treasury securities where the coupon and principal payments have been
separated. Pension funds typically prefer principal STRIPS because they have no coupon payments
and so are longer‐duration securities, allowing pension funds to better match their long‐duration
liabilities. STRIPS data are typically used when looking at pension fund dynamics given the longer
time lag for other available data on pension funds.
Page 58 of 138

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR) September 14, 2018
also shows that this activity has already decelerated in the third quarter, with
monthly data (not shown) indicating a steady decline in activity since June.
Consequently, this pattern does not suggest a current run‐up in pension fund
demand for Treasury securities in the months leading up to the mid‐September
deadline.
Second, survey‐based estimates of pension fund contributions also indicate that
corporate contributions thus far have not increased significantly in 2018, with some
estimating that total contributions will be smaller than in 2017.2 Other long‐dated
fixed‐income markets where pension funds are active have also not shown signs of
increased demand. For example, while the Treasury yield curve has flattened, the
curve for investment‐grade credit spreads has actually steepened this year.
Even if the change in tax policy lowers demand for Treasury securities by pension
funds after mid‐September, other important factors driving pension fund demand
are likely to persist beyond mid‐September. First, outperformance of equities
relative to fixed income typically leads pension funds to de‐risk and increasingly
rebalance their portfolios into fixed income. This factor behind pension fund
demand for Treasury securities is unlikely to change after September. Second, the
variable premium that pension funds pay based on their level of underfunding has
been increasing and is expected to increase further in the coming year.3 This factor
is expected to continue to drive pension funds’ need to improve their funded status
and demand high‐quality fixed‐income securities such as Treasury securities.
In sum, it seems unlikely that any material shift in pension fund demand for Treasury
securities will occur in mid‐September. Market pricing currently also does not show
evidence of concerns of a potential increase in interest rate volatility in mid‐ ss
tt
ee
September. More broadly, the factors highlighted in previous staff work as driving kk

long‐dated yields—including changes in the estimated longer‐run neutral rate and aa

aa
persist.4 Nonetheless, the staff will continue to monitor pension fund demand and ccii

the potential effect on the Treasury yield curve. aa
nn
FFii
2 Estimates from a Pensions & Investments survey indicated total contributions for 2018 will be
around $30 billion. Assuming effects similar to previous staff studies, demand for Treasury
securities of this magnitude would imply a decline in term premiums of just a few basis points.
3 Corporate pension funds are required to pay premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (PBGC). The variable component of the premium is determined as a given percentage
of a pension’s unfunded liabilities. This rate has increased from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent since
2015 and is expected to increase further to 4.0 percent in 2019. For additional information on
these factors, see Pooja Gupta, Monica Scheid, and Jason Warner (2018), “Pension Fund Demand
for Fixed Income Products,” MarketSource (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
May 8).

economy outweighed negative international developments. Stock prices increased for
most sectors in the S&P 500 index, as the final group of second-quarter earnings reports
came in strong and analysts’ earnings expectations for the rest of the year, which
typically weaken after a reporting season, stayed firm. However, concerns about
prospects in EMEs—particularly with respect to trade policy and China—appeared to
weigh on stocks in the energy sector, which fell notably, and those in the basic materials
sector, which also declined. The VIX moved down a bit, on net, and remains somewhat
above the extremely low levels seen in late 2017.
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade
corporate bonds were little changed on net. As a result, spreads of corporate bond yields
over comparable-maturity Treasury yields also were about unchanged. Overall, yields
and spreads on corporate bonds remained at the low ends of their respective historical
distributions.
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
Since the August FOMC meeting, risk sentiment in global financial markets
deteriorated amid significant stress in some EMEs, increased focus on the course of fiscal
policy in Italy, and continued trade tensions. Foreign economic data releases were
generally in line with market expectations and did not materially move foreign
asset prices.

macroeconomic vulnerabilities and reliance on external financing, such as South Africa,
Brazil, and Russia, also came under considerable pressure. Stronger EMEs such as South
Korea and Thailand held up better. Overall, broad measures of EME equity prices
declined about 6 percent, with the Shanghai Composite declining 7 percent on continuing
trade tensions. Outflows over the intermeeting period from mutual funds that invest in
emerging market bonds and equities have been small.
In the AFEs, major equity price indexes fell 2 to 6 percent. European bank stocks
moved down 9 percent on concerns about Brexit, fiscal policy in Italy, and potential
exposures to Turkey and other EMEs. Movements in AFE sovereign yields were mixed,
with slight declines in German bund yields and modest increases in Japanese sovereign
yields. Euro-area peripheral spreads to German equivalents widened, led by a 25 basis
point increase in Italian spreads.
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS
Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over the intermeeting period.
The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) ticked up from 1.91 percent to 1.92 percent,
narrowing its spread relative to IOER to 3 basis points. In the triparty Treasury repo
market, rates averaged 1.91 percent, 16 basis points above the ON RRP rate and about
unchanged from the previous intermeeting period. An elevated level of Treasury bills
outstanding, following heavy issuance this summer, reportedly has continued to put
s

nonfinancial A2/P2 CP and three- and six-month negotiable certificates of deposit to OIS,
edged down over the intermeeting period. Assets under management at prime money
market funds (MMFs) continued to move up but remained well below the levels that
prevailed prior to the implementation of MMF reforms in 2016.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that financing conditions for
businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity. Financing flows to
business and households have been solid but moderated a bit in recent months. Credit
quality remained strong, on balance, although some signs of deterioration emerged.
• Gross issuance of corporate bonds and banks’ extensions of C&I loans
moderated in July and August. In contrast, new-money leveraged loan
issuance was robust.
• Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and credit
demand among small business owners showed signs of strengthening, albeit
from a low base.
• Mortgage credit remained widely available to most borrowers in recent
months. For borrowers with low credit scores, lending conditions continued
to ease but remain somewhat tight. Growth of home-purchase mortgages
slowed, likely reflecting the run-up in mortgage rates earlier this year.
• Consumer credit continued to expand at a solid pace in recent months even as
interest rates for credit cards and auto loans have continued to rise.
• In this Tealbook, we also provide the staff’s assessment of changes in
financing conditions over the past year (see the box “How Have Business and
Household Borrowing Conditions Changed over the Past Year?”).1 In sum,
nonprice terms and standards appear to have eased over the past year, at least
partially offsetting the rise in interest rates during that time.

How Have Business and Household Borrowing Conditions
Changed over the Past Year?
Since September 2017, key interest rates for business and household borrowers
have continued to increase, broadly in line with increases in the federal funds
rate (table 1). Borrowing conditions overall, however, have not tightened as
much as these increases might suggest, in part because nonprice credit terms
and standards across several categories of credit have eased.
In the business sector, investor appetite for corporate debt has been supported
by lower corporate tax rates and strong corporate earnings over the past year as
well as generally strong corporate credit quality. In addition, a rising short-term
interest rate environment has particularly increased investor demand for
floating-rate corporate debt. This dynamic has contributed to an easing of
corporate loan standards and terms, especially in the leveraged loan market,
where “covenant lite” loans are common and other terms have continued to
ease (figure 1). Partly in response to the increased competition from capital
markets and other lenders, banks have eased terms and standards on C&I loans
(figure 2).
Indications of credit conditions easing over the past year are also apparent for
small businesses. The share of small business owners reporting that it is “easy”
or “somewhat easy” to obtain credit over the past 12 months has been steadily
trending upward (figure 3).
Nonprice terms and standards in commercial real estate (CRE) markets have also
eased a bit. A moderate net share of banks reported in the SLOOS that they have
eased standards and terms on nonfarm nonresidential and multifamily CRE loans
over the past year. Banks cited increased competition from bank and nonbank
lenders and an improved outlook for the sector as reasons for the easing. In the

CMBS market, the share of interest-only loans has increased (figure 4), although
underwriting on other dimensions has remained stable.
Terms and standards have also eased in residential mortgage lending. The
maximum debt-service-to-income ratio available on mortgage loans for subprime
borrowers, for example, has been easing steadily for the past several years
(figure 5). One factor contributing to the easing is that mortgage lenders face
strong incentives to keep up the volume of originations in order to cover their
high fixed costs. The rise in interest rates has depressed mortgage refinancing
originations, so lenders have an incentive to ease terms so that more borrowers
qualify. Meanwhile, extremely low delinquency rates on mortgage loans may
have also contributed to lender willingness to ease mortgage standards
and terms.
In contrast, in credit card and auto lending markets, lender risk appetite for
extending credit to subprime consumers appears to have diminished a bit,
perhaps because of rising (though still low) delinquency rates among these
consumers. A significant net share of banks reported in July 2018 that their
standards on both subprime credit cards (figure 6) and subprime auto loans were
at the tighter end of the range of standards on such loans since 2005. However,
standards for prime borrowers in both markets appear broadly unchanged over
the past year.

Taken together, these indicators suggest that the effects of the rise in interest
rates on broad financing conditions have been offset to some degree by an
easing of terms and standards in many markets.1 While there is no definitive
summary statistic to characterize the aggregate net effect of rising rates and
easing availability, the net effect of these developments on a given borrower
may depend on that borrower’s characteristics. A stylized fact in the academic
literature is that the borrowing decisions of those with easy access to credit are
primarily governed by interest rates, whereas terms and standards have a larger
effect on credit-constrained borrowers. If so, given that interest rates are still
low by historical standards, the increasing availability of credit in several markets
may imply that credit conditions have eased, on net, for many credit-constrained
borrowers.
1 This discussion assumes that an increase in interest rates represents a tightening of
financing conditions. To the extent that interest rates have risen because firms’ expected
returns on investment have increased, financing conditions are not necessarily tighter relative
to productive opportunities.

declined, in part due to strong earnings, rising rates, and seasonal factors. In July and
August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while C&I loan growth
moderated. An abundance of M&A activity drove new-money leveraged loan issuance
higher, while the run-up in spreads earlier this year reportedly led to significantly weaker
refinancing issuance.
Meanwhile, the pace of equity issuance through both initial and seasoned
offerings was solid in July but fell, due to seasonal factors, in August. The volumes of
announced and completed M&A deals in recent months continued their upward trend
since the beginning of the year, with the value of completed deals reaching its highest
level in three years. Volumes of announced and completed share repurchases stayed near
their respective all-time highs.
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong over
the intermeeting period, though some signs of deterioration emerged. The aggregate
KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms rose in September because
of an increase in firm liabilities and now stands near its historical median. Despite
dipping slightly in August, the six-month trailing bond default rate remained near its
highest level in two years and stayed above the median of its historical distribution.
The reporting season for second-quarter corporate earnings drew to a close during
the intermeeting period, with earnings per share for nearly all sectors of the S&P 500
showing strong gains. Wall Street analysts project robust growth in earnings for S&P
500 companies over the next year.

Financial Conditions Indexes
Over the past decade, market participants, academics, and policy institutions have created an
increasing number of financial conditions indexes (FCIs).1 These indexes were developed for three
main purposes: to summarize overall financial market developments, to assess how monetary
policy is transmitted to financial conditions, and to gauge what financial conditions presage for
future economic activity.
The blue shaded region in figure 1 displays the range of values over time across five publicly
available FCIs, developed by Goldman Sachs; Bloomberg; and the Federal Reserve Banks of
Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis. The mean of these indexes is plotted as the black line.2
Although they are based on different numbers and types of financial variables, these indexes share
broadly similar variations, especially during periods of widespread financial market stress such as
the financial crisis of 2007–09.3 They all point to a broad easing of financial conditions since
December 2015, even as the FOMC has gradually raised the federal funds rate from its lower bound.
The existing FCIs are typically constructed by aggregating financial variables into one summary
series using methods such as principal component analysis, weighted averages, and dynamic factor
models.4 While these composite indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market
movements, they share two main drawbacks when used to assess the link between financial
1 A partial list of widely used FCIs includes those developed by Goldman Sachs; Deutsche Bank; Citi; Bloomberg;
IMF; OECD; and the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.
2 To facilitate the comparison, each index is normalized by subtracting its mean and then dividing by its
standard deviation. Values of the indexes above (below) zero indicate tighter (looser) financial conditions than on
average. An index value of 1.0 denotes financial conditions that are tighter than average by one standard deviation.
3 The number of variables included in the FCIs ranges from 5 in the Goldman Sachs index to more than 100 in
the Chicago Fed index.
4 For example, the highly watched GS-FCI is a weighted average of five financial variables (the federal funds
rate, the 10-year Treasury yield, the corporate BBB–Treasury yields spread, the S&P price-to-earnings ratio, and the
broad value of the U.S. dollar), with weights chosen based on the effects of these variables on real GDP growth
using a VAR model.

markets, the real economy, and monetary policy. First, the weights used to aggregate financial
variables are typically determined by statistical methods rather than justified by how these
variables affect economic activity. Second, these indexes do not differentiate between the various
channels—such as the wealth channel, the credit condition channel, and the terms-of-trade
channel—through which financial variables affect the real economy.
In an attempt to overcome these shortcomings, the staff recently developed an alternative index
that is designed to measure financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations. This index uses
only information from firms’ stock returns and credit ratings. Roughly speaking, it is constructed as
the difference in equity returns between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just
below investment grade.5 Due to credit market imperfections, speculative-grade firms are more
sensitive to changes in overall financing conditions than comparable investment-grade firms. To
the extent that financing condition risks are priced in the equity market, investment-grade firms
can be expected to outperform speculative-grade firms when financing conditions tighten, leading
to a wider returns differential.
This alternative staff index has three main properties. First, by focusing on the cost and availability
of funding to nonfinancial corporations, this index captures a well-defined channel through which
financial conditions affect the economy. Second, it provides a clean measure of changes in
financing conditions by comparing two groups of firms that mainly differ in their access to capital
markets. Third, it has better in-sample forecasting power for economic activity than other available
financial conditions indexes (not shown).6
As shown by the red line in figure 2, the staff’s index exhibits countercyclical variations and
effectively captures several episodes of stress in the U.S. financial system. It co-moves with the
range of other FCIs, and, like the other FCIs, indicates that financing conditions have eased
since liftoff.

components of the cumulative log returns of the two portfolios. The systematic components are derived from the

Fama-French five-factor asset pricing model, augmented with the momentum and quality/junk factors. n
6 One important limitation of this index is that it does not capture changes in financing conditions for private n
ci
nonfinancial firms, financial institutions, or households. Another limitation of this index is that firms in both groups a
n
are assumed to have similar exposure to nonfinancing conditions shocks. Fi

well above year-earlier levels. Although the demand for credit by small businesses still
appears weak relative to pre-crisis levels, the National Federation of Independent
Business optimism index has moved higher in recent months, suggesting a further
strengthening of small business credit demand in coming months. While indicators of
recent small business loan performance remained strong, delinquency rates on such loans
have been rising slowly over the past several months.
Commercial Real Estate
Financing conditions for commercial real estate also remained accommodative.
Although CRE loan growth at banks moderated in July and August, issuance of CMBS
was robust. Market participants expect CMBS issuance to slow in the near term because
of declines in both the volume of maturing pre-crisis-era loans that need to be refinanced
and the volume of property acquisitions that require purchase loans. CMBS spreads were
little changed and remained near their post-crisis lows.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS
Over the intermeeting period, financing continued to be readily available to
municipalities. Yields on 20-year municipal bonds increased slightly over the
intermeeting period, as did their ratios over comparable-maturity Treasury yields. Gross
issuance of municipal bonds remained solid. The credit quality of state and local
governments improved in recent months, as the number of credit rating upgrades
outpaced the number of downgrades. The recent agreement between Puerto Rico GO and
COFINA bondholders over the division of future sales tax revenues resulted in a marked
increase in the price of Puerto Rico’s benchmark GO bonds.

remained largely supportive of growth in household spending. However, the supply of
credit to consumers with subprime credit scores remained tight. More broadly, although
interest rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise, consumer credit expanded
at a solid pace.2 Conditions in the consumer ABS market remained favorable, with
issuance remaining robust and spreads holding at very low levels.

Recent Auto Loan Growth at U.S. Credit Unions
Auto lending has recovered strongly, on balance, since 2012. Nominal
outstanding loan balances rebounded from their post-crisis nadir of $700 billion
to over $1.1 trillion in 2018:Q2. This discussion highlights that auto loan growth at
credit unions was particularly strong and persistent over this period, resulting in a
notable expansion in credit unions’ share of the U.S. auto loan market. The
expansion of credit unions’ auto lending appears to be concentrated among
borrowers with better credit scores and so does not appear to represent a
loosening of lending standards.
Over the past five years, the average annual growth of auto loans from credit
unions was about 13 percent, more than that from depository institutions (about
7 percent) and finance companies (about 3 percent).1 Moreover, although auto
lending at banks and finance companies has moderated over the past two years
as interest rates gradually rose, growth at credit unions has remained strong
(figure 1). Indeed, had auto lending growth at credit unions been the same as
that for other types of lenders, total auto loans outstanding would currently be
10 percent (about $120 billion) lower.
Growth in auto lending within the credit union sector has been highly
concentrated among the largest credit unions. As shown in figure 2, median five-
year cumulative auto loan growth was merely 3 percent for credit unions in the
bottom size quintile of the total assets distribution but was 80 percent for credit
unions in the top size quintile.
1 As of July 2018, auto loan balances at depository institutions, credit unions, and finance
companies were about $450 billion, $370 billion, and $300 billion, respectively.

The number of auto loans originated by credit unions grew much faster than that
of other types of lenders. Loans originated to finance new car purchases rose
80 percent over the past five years at credit unions but stayed about flat, on net,
at banks and finance companies (figure 3).2 Over the same period, the average
size of credit union auto loans rose 17 percent, about in line with other lenders.3
As shown in figure 4, the average credit score of new originations from credit
unions increased appreciably while staying roughly flat at other lenders.4 Partly
due to the higher average credit quality of their borrowers, credit union loans, on
average, have lower interest rates than those from banks and finance companies.
Moreover, even with borrower credit scores held constant, loans extended by
credit unions tend to have a lower average interest rate (figure 5), potentially
due, in part, to credit unions’ stable deposit bases and their nonprofit status. As
a result, despite the larger amounts financed, the monthly payments of credit
union auto loans are about the same as those of other lenders.5 Finally, despite
the rapid expansion, delinquency rates on credit union auto loans have remained
low and stable in recent years (figure 6).

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
&
s
k
We view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity over the next year s
Ri
or so as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by the FOMC.
In addition, we see the upside and downside risks around the projections for real GDP growth
and the unemployment rate over that period as being balanced. On the upside, the underlying
fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain strong— bolstered in part
by the tax cuts enacted last year— and readings on household and business sentiment generally
continue to be upbeat. Against this economic backdrop, spending and investment could expand
faster than in the staff projection. On the downside, foreign economic developments and trade
policies could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S economic growth.
Those overall assessments are consistent with the four-quarter-ahead estimates for GDP growth
and the unemployment rate presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”
We are more concerned about recession risks during the period beyond the next year or
so. In our baseline outlook, the economy is currently operating above potential and is projected
to move further beyond its potential over the next two years. If this assessment is correct, then
we anticipate that a significant slowing in the pace of economic activity, along with a gradual
increase in the unemployment rate, will be required in order to return the economy to a
sustainable position in the longer run. During the period of subpar growth, the economy will be
more susceptible to negative shocks that could push it into recession. Neither we nor anyone
else will have clear insight as to the precise timing of when a recession will occur, but the period
of adjustment back to sustainability will be a time of heightened risk.
With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty and balanced risks around
the projection over the next year or so. To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may
not edge up in the coming years. Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more
than expected and put downward pressure on inflation. To the upside, with economic activity
projected to move further above its potential, inflation could increase more than in the staff
forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource
utilization on inflation. In addition, an unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade
barriers could lead to higher inflation. These assessments are consistent with the statistical

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
s
k
s
Ri
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline
projection using simulations of staff models. The first scenario describes the macroeconomic
consequences of an average recession assumed to start in 2021. In the second scenario, higher
realized inflation destabilizes inflation expectations, which leads to persistently higher inflation
and also slower output growth. The third and fourth scenarios provide a comparison of two
different possible causes for faster wage growth: labor supply constraints or faster productivity
growth. In the fifth scenario, we consider the possibility that financial turbulence in emerging
market economies (EMEs) leads to sizable capital outflows and a stronger appreciation of the
dollar. Finally, the last two scenarios illustrate the effects of a widespread increase in trade
barriers. In the sixth scenario, the central bank reacts to total inflation inclusive of the direct
effect of the tariffs on import prices. In the seventh scenario, the central bank “sees through” the
temporary effect of the tariffs on inflation.
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of four staff models that embed different
macroeconomic structures and dynamics. The first two scenarios are simulated with the FRB/US
model; the third and fourth scenarios use a DSGE model developed by Gertler, Sala, and Trigari;
the fifth scenario uses the SIGMA model; and the last two scenarios use the GEMUS model.1 In
all of the scenarios except the first one, the federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule
as in the baseline. (The first scenario, which features a recession, allows for a more aggressive
monetary policy response than would be prescribed by the baseline inertial Taylor rule.) In
addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline
paths in all of the scenarios.
1 The four models used are (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S.
economy; (2) a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market
similar to that described in Mark L. Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari (2008), “ An Estimated Monetary
DSGE Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining,” Journal of Money, Credit and
Banking, vol. 40 (8), pp. 1713– 64; (3) SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model; and (4) GEMUS,
which is a simplified version of SIGMA that is better suited to analyze trade policy issues.

While the probability of a recession in the near future is small, the odds increase further e

s
empirical framework consulted by the staff suggests that the probability of a recession in the
medium term is greater than 75 percent by the end of 2020.2 This scenario assumes that adverse
shocks to financial market spreads and household and business confidence materialize starting in
mid-2021 and that these shocks are sufficient to generate a downturn similar in magnitude to the
median recession over the past 50 years. We also assume that monetary policymakers respond to
sustained increases in the unemployment rate more aggressively than prescribed by the baseline
rule, in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.
In this scenario, real GDP declines at the end of 2021 and begins to recover at the start of
2023. The unemployment rate peaks at 6 percent by the beginning of 2023, an increase of
2½ percentage points from the start of the recession, similar to the median increase in the
unemployment rate in recessions over the past five decades. With the lower level of resource
utilization, inflation runs about ¼ percentage point below baseline, on average, between 2022
and 2024. Despite the sharp deterioration in economic conditions, the federal funds rate is
sufficiently elevated at the onset of the recession that it does not quite reach its effective lower
bound, although it does fall as low as ½ percent in mid-2023. A similar deterioration in
economic activity and inflation occurring two years earlier would result in the federal funds rate
briefly reaching its effective lower bound.
Inflation Fears [FRB/US]
In recent years, private-sector expectations of future inflation have been formed in an
environment mainly characterized by low and stable inflation, generally at or below the
Committee’s 2 percent objective. Considerable uncertainty surrounds how these expectations
might revise if inflation were to run persistently and significantly above that objective. In
particular, an extended period of high inflation may cause longer-run inflation expectations to
2 The model is a logistic regression estimating the probability of being in a recession, as defined by the
NBER, at any time over the next four quarters. The explanatory variables in the regression include the term spread
between the 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate, the term premium on 10-year Treasury yields, the
spread of triple-B-rated bonds over Treasury yields, and the staff’s judgmental output gap.

In this scenario, we assume a steeper Phillips curve such that the tight economy leads to n
U
&
higher inflation than in the baseline projection, possibly as a result of nonlinearities in the
s
k
relation between resource utilization and inflation. Moreover, we assume that, in forming their s
Ri
inflation expectations, households and businesses put more weight on recent inflation experience
than in the baseline. Additionally, in this environment of heightened inflation risk, Treasury
term premiums rise persistently to a level about 1 percentage point above their baseline values.
All told, inflation runs substantially above the Tealbook forecast for several years.
Yields on Treasury securities and corporate bonds rise in response to the assumed increase in
inflation risk premiums, causing GDP growth to be 1 percentage point slower than in the
baseline by the end of 2019. The unemployment rate increases slowly but steadily throughout
the simulation, ending almost 1 percentage point above the baseline (though still only a little
above its assumed sustainable level by the end of the simulation period). Because the baseline
policy rule depends on the lagging four-quarter change in inflation, the monetary policy response
to the shocks in this scenario is initially dominated by the lower level of economic activity rather
than by the higher path of inflation so that the federal funds rate is slightly below baseline until
mid-2022. Beginning at the end of 2022, however, the higher inflation rate dominates, and the
federal funds rate stays persistently 25 basis points above the baseline for the remainder of the
simulation period as inflation is slowly brought back to the Committee’s objective.
Faster Wage Growth, Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model]
Recent data suggest that wages have been rising moderately. While the pace of wage
growth steps up in the medium-term forecast, wages could possibly accelerate more rapidly than
we anticipate. In this scenario and the following one, we analyze two scenarios that feature
significantly faster wage growth than in the baseline. The path for wages in both scenarios is the
same, but, because the underlying sources of the faster wage growth differ, economic outcomes
and the monetary policy response also differ.3 In this scenario, the acceleration in wages is
caused by tighter supply constraints in the labor market, while, in the next scenario, the
3 Both scenarios use the Gertler, Sala, and Trigari model. However, “Faster Wage Growth, Supply
Constraints” uses a nonlinear version of the model in order to emphasize the nonlinear supply constraint, while the
scenario “Faster Wage Growth, Higher Productivity” uses a linear version of the model.

been fully captured in the baseline projection. In particular, when the unemployment rate is
unusually low, filling a vacancy becomes increasingly difficult, which could imply a reduced
pace of hiring and a substantially steeper rise in wages as the value to firms of a filled vacancy
increases. In this scenario, we illustrate these risks using simulations from a nonlinear New
Keynesian model with costly search and matching frictions in the labor market.4
With greater supply constraints, the unemployment rate continues to decline until the
beginning of 2020 but by ¼ percentage point less than in the baseline projection, and this gap
persists over the forecast horizon. Wage growth is nearly 1 percentage point higher than in the
baseline for the next two years before slowing such that the level of wages converges to the
baseline by the end of the projection period. However, GDP growth is close to the baseline
throughout the projection as, in this model, more intense utilization of capital partially
compensates for the reduction in labor input. Because of higher recruiting costs and real wage
growth well in excess of productivity growth, inflation is significantly higher and peaks at
3 percent at the end of 2019. Monetary policymakers are assumed to infer resource slack from
the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, the federal funds rate is slightly above the baseline, as the
effect of higher inflation dominates the effect of the smaller unemployment rate gap.
Faster Wage Growth, Higher Productivity [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model]
In contrast to the previous scenario, in this scenario, we generate the same faster wage
growth through sizable increases in multifactor productivity along with somewhat greater
aggregate demand; as a result, the level of labor productivity is, on average, 1 percentage point
higher than baseline for four years before returning slowly to the baseline.
The boom in productivity growth unleashes a surge in economic activity. Real GDP
growth rises sharply, cresting above 4 percent at the start of 2019, and the unemployment rate
falls well below the baseline. Because labor productivity growth exceeds real wage growth,

In our baseline, we continue to expect solid growth in most EMEs despite some recent
increases in financial stresses. Although Argentina and Turkey are in crisis, their weight in
global finance and trade is very small; we do not expect their problems to affect the U.S.
economy directly, and they are not likely to spill over materially to other EMEs. Even so, other
EMEs also harbor vulnerabilities, including high sovereign and private debt, which may be
exacerbated by ongoing U.S. monetary policy normalization, especially if investor confidence is
weakened by heightening geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions, or political uncertainties. In
this scenario, we assume that EMEs experience a broad-based deterioration of financial
conditions that is accompanied by substantial capital outflows and currency depreciation,
generating sizable adverse spillovers to the United States and advanced foreign economies.
Specifically, this scenario assumes that declining confidence fuels an ongoing flight from
EME assets, causing credit spreads to widen 125 basis points and EME currencies to depreciate
sharply. Flight-to-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets reduce the term premiums on U.S.
Treasury securities 30 basis points and cause corporate bond spreads to rise 50 basis points both
in the United States and in the advanced foreign economies, while the broad real dollar
appreciates 10 percent.
Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial conditions
restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States. U.S. GDP growth moderates to
2 percent in 2019, about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline, and core PCE inflation runs
only a little above 1½ percent. The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the
baseline.
Higher Trade Barriers [GEMUS]
The current process of widespread trade negotiations is unprecedented in the post– World
War II period, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. Accordingly, beyond the measures
already implemented, which should have a relatively limited effect on aggregate economic
activity, we have not built any additional trade policy actions into our baseline outlook. If the

process ultimately leads to lower trade barriers around the world, there could be significant y
t
n
positive effects on the United States and foreign economies. Conversely, an outcome of ai
t
r
widespread and sustained increases in trade barriers would likely entail sizable adverse effects. e
c
n
U
&
This scenario considers the latter possibility. In particular, we assume that the United
s
k
States increases tariffs on all non-oil imported goods 15 percentage points and that foreign s
Ri
economies impose a similar-sized increase in tariffs on U.S. exports. Because higher U.S. tariffs
reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have little effect
on the trade balance. However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses
household spending while business spending declines, both as a result of the higher cost of
imported capital goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise.
In addition, we assume that productivity growth slows as a result of a shift in production to less
efficient domestic firms and industries as well as a reduction in international competition that
diminishes incentives to innovate.
The tariff-driven rise in import prices causes core PCE inflation to surge temporarily to
3¼ percent in the first half of 2019. Monetary policy initially reacts to the temporary run-up in
inflation by tightening faster than in the baseline, with the federal funds rate rising to almost
4 percent in early 2019. All told, these developments push the U.S. economy into a mild
recession lasting until the end of 2019, and the unemployment rate rises to 4¼ percent. The
federal funds rate moves below the baseline starting in 2020, as inflation returns close to baseline
and the unemployment rate remains well above the baseline.
We have limited experience with the large and broad-based increases in trade barriers
contemplated in this scenario, and, accordingly, there is unusually large uncertainty around our
estimates. The declines in productivity associated with higher trade barriers could show through
to aggregate output either more slowly or more rapidly than indicated in the simulation. It is also
possible that a prolonged period of trade tensions causes declines in consumer and business
confidence as well as further deterioration in financial market conditions. And, notably, the
simulation does not take into account hard-to-model features— including disruptions to global
supply chains or the effects of policy uncertainty on business investment— which might have an
especially large effect on economic activity here and abroad.

t
n
ai
t
r
e In the previous scenario, we assumed that monetary policy responds to the temporary
c
n
U surge in inflation caused by the higher tariffs by raising the federal funds rate. This scenario
&
s considers the same hikes in U.S. and foreign tariffs as in the previous scenario but assumes
k
s
Ri instead that monetary policy “sees through” this short-lived rise in inflation and lowers the policy
rate. Specifically, we assume here that the policy rule responds to a different measure of
inflation that nets out the direct effects of tariffs.
In this case, the federal funds rate runs persistently below baseline in response to weaker
economic activity and remains below 4 percent at the end of 2020. The more accommodative
monetary policy response cushions the output decline enough to avoid a recession, with output
growth bottoming out at about ½ percent in mid-2019, about ¾ percentage point above the
previous scenario in which policy does not see through the spike in inflation. Inflation jumps
above 3¼ percent in mid-2019, just a little higher than in the previous scenario, and then falls
just as sharply.
The more accommodative policy response considered here attenuates the output decline
considerably—relative to the previous scenario— without much effect on inflation. Accordingly,
the see-through policy would seem an appropriate response to a tariff hike. However, the
desirability of this strategy depends on firmly anchored inflation expectations and the pass-
through of cost shocks into inflation being relatively short lived. If those conditions do not hold,
then the alternative approach assumed in the previous scenario could be more attractive. In
particular, inflation and inflation expectations might run persistently higher if the tariff hike leads
workers to raise their wage demands or firms to raise their markups. These effects might be
intensified in a very tight labor market.

Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from c

Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”
&

This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Ri s
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.” In the four large fan charts, the black dotted
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices. (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction. Similarly, the
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home” component for years
before it was included in core.)
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts. The thin black lines show
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period. At the bottom of the
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section. The annual data
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment
rate from 1930 to 1946.1
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data. For the
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for a sample starting in 1980,
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors. For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used. This shorter range reflects both more limited
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation
since the mid-1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation
reaching further back. In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile
bands of the errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the
median of the prediction intervals. There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate
meaningful 90 percent ranges for the two inflation series. A median line above the staff forecast
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the
t
y
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection
n
ai errors with information from outside forecasters: the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of
t
r
e Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, we calculate prediction
c
n
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts. We then calculate the
U
& change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and
s
k apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands. That is, we assume that any
s
Ri
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections. Limitations on the availability of data
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes. In particular, because data on
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of
data revisions for each series. The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those
in the Tealbook baseline projection. Resource utilization is projected to be a bit less tight
in the near term, and inflation is projected to be a touch higher. Overall, these revisions
imply that the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies are little changed from
those in the previous Tealbook. A special exhibit illustrates how policy prescriptions and
macroeconomic outcomes under flexible price-level targeting (FPLT) depend on the
reference date for the target path for the price level. A second special exhibit provides
updated estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run. The revised
historical NIPA data and data over the first half of the year imply small upward revisions
for most estimates and somewhat larger ones in a couple of cases.
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal
funds rate from four simple policy rules: the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the
“balanced approach” rule), the Taylor (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and an FPLT
rule. These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for
the output gap and core inflation, shown in the middle panels.1 The top and middle
panels also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is
constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2
Relative to the July Tealbook, the staff projects resource utilization to be a bit less
tight over the next 18 months and inflation to be a touch higher. Because the effects of
these changes to the forecast mostly offset each other, the prescriptions of all of the
policy rules are little changed from the previous Tealbook.
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
1 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of
the output gap.
2 Except for the first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2018 median SEP responses.
The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline projections

policy rates in the Tealbook baseline. The near-term prescriptions of the first-
difference rule, for which adjustments are gradual, essentially coincide with
those of the Tealbook baseline.
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising
the federal funds rate in the near term, the FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate
the cumulative shortfall in the core PCE price index of about 2¼ percent since
the end of 2011, prescribes setting the federal funds rate near the bottom of
the current target range.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium-term concept
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2018 Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP).3 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used
to generate an estimate of r*.4 This concept of r*, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to
the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting
in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that
period. This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real
economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation
objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate.
• At 3.29 percent, the estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* in this
quarter is 15 basis points below the corresponding value computed using the
July Tealbook projection. The downward revision reflects the fact that the
staff has revised downward its projection for the output gap at the end of the
12-quarter period.
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model,
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the
final year reported in the June 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer-run values in a smooth and
monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer-run value.
4 The staff implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model in preparing the
July Tealbook. The SEP-consistent FRB/US r* continues to use the previous version of the model because
of data compatibility limitations.

• At 1.80 percent, the SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*. The difference stems from the fact that the
SEP-consistent projection has output exceeding potential by a considerably
smaller amount over the medium term than does the current Tealbook
forecast. This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by the SEP projections
averages almost 1 percentage point less than the corresponding path in the
Tealbook.

inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.5 The

a
t
e to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and
n
o
M wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this
commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy.
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases ½ percentage
point over the remainder of this year and rises, on average, 1 percentage point
per year for the following three years, reaching 5 percent in the fourth quarter
of 2021.
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding
Tealbook baseline values through mid-2022. This higher path is associated
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield than
in the baseline until 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter, because the
Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate
beyond the period shown. Because wage and price setting today is influenced
by expected future outcomes in the FRB/US model, and because the Taylor
(1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative policy later in the
5 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal
funds rate paths, the near-term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in
the top panel of the first exhibit.

simulation, starting in the fourth quarter inflation is somewhat higher than in
the baseline projection. The path for the unemployment rate lies above the
Tealbook baseline path over the next few years, but it subsequently lies below
and takes a bit longer to return to its natural rate.6
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
output exceeding its assumed potential level over the projection period, the
prescriptions of this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over
the period shown. The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher
than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, but, starting in 2021, the
path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline path for a sustained
period. As a result, inflation is higher, and the real 10-year Treasury yield is
lower, than their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection. The more
accommodative conditions engender a more pronounced undershooting of the
unemployment rate below its natural rate beyond the medium term.
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first-difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020, but runs
below the baseline path for some years thereafter. The latter divergence
occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the decline in the
output gap that is projected beyond 2020. The associated lower path of the
federal funds rate and the expectation of higher inflation in the future imply
lower longer-term real interest rates than in the Tealbook baseline. Thus, the
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are
lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than the corresponding
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection.
6 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this and the Taylor (1993) rule
simulations, despite higher levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage
setting decisions. The box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage
setters lack such a perfect understanding. In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non-inertial
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the
simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.

• The FPLT rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall, since the end
of 2011, of core PCE inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent. The FPLT
rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate slightly below its third-quarter
value in the Tealbook baseline projection until the first quarter of 2020 and
maintaining a markedly slower pace of increases thereafter than in the
Tealbook baseline. This prescription generates a higher rate of inflation in
coming years that eventually undoes the 2¼ percentage point shortfall of the
core PCE price index relative to a path that rises 2 percent per year since the
end of 2011. Because the simulation embeds the assumptions that
policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the
real 10-year Treasury rate drops below the Tealbook baseline for the next six
years. The unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook
baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping below 2½ percent in 2020.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a
constraint may improve economic outcomes.8
The first three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline projection, for two reasons. First, high
levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up to its
natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the unemployment rate
does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model. Second,
because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications. The appendix in this Tealbook
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.
8 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). It is assumed that these promises
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.

front-loading of policy tightening is not disruptive. In practice, however, if the FOMC
were to raise the real federal funds rate abruptly, wage and price setters and financial
market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate
tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, leading to less benign
macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.9 By contrast, the fourth optimal control
policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels not experienced since the 1950s.
Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those predicted by the
simulations.
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous
value. Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate over the next
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with
the equal-weights loss function judge to be costly.10 The small projected
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates only
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of
inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.
• The second simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise
identical to that specification. Even though policymakers attach larger losses
to deviations of inflation from 2 percent, they nonetheless choose a federal
funds rate path that results in inflation undershooting the inflation objective by
more than under the baseline policy over the period shown, for two reasons.
9 See note 6 for a related discussion in the case of simple policy rules.
10 When we use the June 2018 SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5½ percent, compared
with about 8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

First, policymakers seek to undo the modest but persistent overshoot of the
inflation objective over the next decade, which they see as costly. Second,
policymakers continue to attach significant losses to the unemployment rate
undershooting its natural rate. On net, the federal funds rate path is only
modestly less restrictive than under the equal-weights specification.
• The third simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. This
simulated policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even
s
e faster than under the equal-weights specification. The federal funds rate soars
gi
e
t to 11 percent by mid-2019 and then averages around 7½ percent from 2020
a
r

o • The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
P

t
e rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but the loss
n
o
M function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the
unemployment rate is above the natural rate. Under this strategy, the path of
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control
simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path in the
medium term; later in the 2020s it exceeds the policy paths implied by all
other optimal control strategies and the Tealbook baseline (not shown). With
the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this more accommodative
path for the policy rate because their desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent
is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of
unemployment. The tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent
than in the case of equal weights. Beyond the period shown, the
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the
prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.

influences the policy rates prescriptions of FPLT rules and their associated economic
outcomes. We compare the results from simulations of two FPLT rules with those from
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule—the same rule used to construct the
Tealbook baseline path for the federal funds rate—under both the Tealbook baseline
projection and a demand-driven recession scenario. The first rule, “FPLT (2011:Q4),”
sets the reference date for the target path for the price level to 2011:Q4, resulting in an
initial price-level gap in 2018:Q4 of 2¼ percent. The second rule, “FPLT (2017:Q4),”
sets the reference date to 2017:Q4, implying an initial price-level gap in 2018:Q4 of
roughly zero. For both FPLT rules, the coefficient on the unemployment gap is chosen to
deliver the same marginal response to resource utilization as the inertial Taylor (1999)
rule and is almost double the size of the coefficient used in the “Flexible price-level
targeting rule” shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations.”
The simulations conditional on the Tealbook baseline projection are shown in the
panels on the left.
• Given the large initial price-level gap, the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule prescribes a
lower path of the federal funds rate than under the Tealbook baseline, leading
to markedly lower unemployment and modestly higher inflation over the
period shown. Consequently, the price-level gap closes gradually; at the end
of 2024 the price level is still 1 percent below the target path.11
• The “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule leads to policy prescriptions and macroeconomic
outcomes similar to those associated with the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.12 In
part, this result reflects the fact that this FPLT rule has the same marginal
response to resource utilization as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule. Moreover,
the price-level gaps in this FPLT rule and the deviations of inflation from
2 percent in the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are very small over the period
11 The “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule is less accommodative in these circumstances than the “Flexible
price-level targeting rule” shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations.” Both rules use the same
reference date to define the price-level gap and have the same coefficient on that gap; however, under the
“FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule, policymakers respond more strongly to an unemployment rate that is below the
natural rate.
12 The path of the federal funds rate under the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule is below the Tealbook
baseline projections in the near term but is higher further in the future. The same is true for the real 10-year
Treasury yield. Because inflation is forward looking in the FRB/US model, the inflation rate under the
“FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule is lower than under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.

Note: The FPLT rules used herein respond to the unemployment gap with a coefficient of −1.85. We constructed the
recession scenario in the FRB/US model by subjecting the Tealbook baseline to a sequence of negative spending shocks
starting in the fourth quarter of 2018, the first quarter in the simulation. In constructing the recession scenario, we
assumed that the federal funds rate is determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.

shown. Accordingly, the different price objectives in the two rules do not
result in materially different policy prescriptions.
The price-level gap inherited under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule similarly affects
the path of policy and macroeconomic outcomes under a moderate demand-driven
recession scenario, as illustrated in the panels on the right.13
• Given the large inherited price-level gap, the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule
prescribes a much lower path for the federal funds rate than the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule in the recession scenario, as was the case in the previous
scenario.14 The much lower path for the federal funds rate helps combat the
recession by curbing the rise in the unemployment rate relative to the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule. Inflation stays above 2 percent, causing the price-level
gap to narrow, even during the recession.
• By comparison, policymakers provide only slightly more stimulus to the
economy under the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule than under the inertial Taylor
(1999) rule. The path of the federal funds rate is initially higher under this
FPLT rule but falls below the path under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule in the
medium term, reflecting policymakers’ promise to undo the shortfalls in
inflation from 2 percent during the recession. Price and wage setters
anticipate this relatively accommodative period, and, as a result, inflation
stays closer to 2 percent under the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule than under the
inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the path of the unemployment rate is
slightly lower.
• As our simulations illustrate, whether FPLT rules provide substantially more
accommodation in demand-driven recessions than rules such as the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule in which deviations from the inflation objective are
“bygones” hinges on the magnitude of the initial price-level gap.15 In
13 The demand-driven recession scenario in the FRB/US model is constructed by subjecting the
Tealbook baseline to a sequence of negative spending shocks starting in 2018:Q4 that raise the
unemployment rate by close to the median increase of past recessions. In constructing this scenario, we
assume that the federal funds rate is determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.
14 The federal funds rate remains positive under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule throughout the
simulation.
15 In a supply-driven recession, the price level would be higher than otherwise. Accordingly, the
“FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule might prescribe tighter monetary policy than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule because
the FPLT rule would promise to undo the positive price-level gap stemming from a period of above
2 percent inflation caused by the negative supply shocks.

addition, the efficacy of an FPLT rule crucially depends on the public’s
understanding of this policy and the public’s beliefs about policymakers’
commitment to this rule and, in particular, to the reference date. If the public
does not expect policymakers to eliminate the price-level gap specified in the
FPLT rule, the public will anticipate future policy to be tighter than
otherwise. Consequently, long-term interest rates would be higher, inhibiting
policymakers’ ability to stabilize the economy.
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The next exhibit, “Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the
Longer Run,” updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the
longer run, denoted rLR; this concept is the rate consistent with the economy operating at
its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated. The top panel of
the exhibit shows the range of historical values through 2018:Q2 for several model-based
time-series estimates of rLR . 16 The estimates for 2018:Q2 range from ½ to 1¾ percent.
Relative to their respective 2017:Q4 values reported in the March Tealbook, five of the
measures increased by less than 20 basis points from their 2017:Q4 levels. The estimates
from Laubach and Williams (2003) and Lubik and Matthes (2015) have risen by more
than 50 basis points. In the case of Laubach and Williams (2003), the increase is due to
revisions in the historical NIPA data that have caused the current and past estimates of
rLR to be higher, primarily because trend growth in real GDP, one of the factors
determining rLR, is now estimated to be more variable. In the case of Lubik and Matthes
(2015), the increase reflects the effect of including data through the first half of this year.
The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer-term forecasts of the real federal funds rate
from selected sources. The Tealbook baseline assumption, at ½ percent, is below the
other measures, which range from 0.75 to 1.15 percent. That said, the Tealbook baseline
assumption remains well within the uncertainty bands of most time-series estimates.
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.
16 For a discussion of time-series estimates of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies
section of the October 2017 Tealbook. See the appendix to this section for sources.

Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into
one of two categories. Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors. Under
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes. Both
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Unless otherwise noted, the
simulations embed the assumption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that
policymakers will follow through with their strategy, but also fully understand the
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. Such policy strategies are described as
commitment strategies.
The two approaches have different merits and limitations. The parsimony of simple rules
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to
uncertainty about the structure of the economy. However, simple rules omit, by construction,
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times,
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And,
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can
commit. That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the
particular model.
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when
pursuing their mandated objectives.
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section. It also reports the expression for the inertial
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version, augmented with a small
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection.

version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price gap like the flexible price-level

similar to the one above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted , are constant and chosen
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run inflation objectiv𝐿𝐿e𝐿𝐿 and an equilibrium real

federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent. The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see
Orphanides (2003).
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES
The “Near-Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap. When the
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next
quarters. When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the
next two quarters. Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are

conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of
Economic Projections (SEP). The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy. “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection.2 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors,
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.3 The
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based
expectations—that is, agents use small-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP-consistent projection, respectively,
calculated over the same 12-quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent and SEP-consistent
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when
their values are identical. The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds
rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the
real federal funds rate can vary over time.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US
model. Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as
price and wage setters form model-consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s
large-scale asset purchase programs. When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.
2 The staff implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model ahead of the July
2018 Tealbook. The SEP-consistent FRB/US r* continues to use the previous version of the model
because of data compatibility limitations.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE
price inflation, , and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at
all times. The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large
weight to inflation gaps. The third specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The fourth specification, “Asymmetric
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate. The optimal control policy and associated
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to

ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline. The path chosen by policymakers today is
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the
simulation period. The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown
in the exhibits.
FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING WITH ALTERNATIVE PRICE-LEVEL GAPS
The FPLT rules underlying the simulations shown in the special exhibit “Flexible Price-
Level Targeting with Alternative Price-Level Gaps” are of the form
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 ∗ ∗
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 0.85𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1+ 0.15(𝑟𝑟 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + (𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 −𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡) −1.85(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡)).
Under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule, the 2011:Q4 value of is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the
core PCE price index, and, subsequently, is assumed to ∗grow at a 2 percent annual rate. Under
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule, the 2017:Q4 va∗lue of is set to the 2017:Q4 value of the core PCE
price index, and, subsequently, is assum
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
ed to gro∗w at a 2 percent annual rate. We set the
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
coefficient on the unemployment∗ gap to -1.85, which would imply a coefficient of 1 on the output
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡
gap under the Okun’s law relationship assumed by the staff in constructing the projection.
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN
The top panel of the exhibit “Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of from eight time-series models based on the
following studies: Christensen and Rudebusc𝐿𝐿h𝐿𝐿 (2017); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, and
𝑟𝑟
Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016);
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and
Matthes (2015). For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data
through 2018:Q2. Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they
make use of historical data only up to that point in time. As a result, their historical movements
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each
model’s point estimate for 2018:Q2. The computation and interpretation of these bands are
specific to each study.
The bottom panel shows values from selected forecasters. These values were
obtained as follows: 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿
